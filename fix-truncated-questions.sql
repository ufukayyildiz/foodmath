## Abstract

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of environmental stresses on the cytotoxicity of Shiga toxin-producing  *Escherichia coli*  (STEC). STEC O157:H7 and six non-O157 STEC strains (O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, O111:NM, O121:NM, and O145:NM) were subjected to osmotic (aw 0.95–0.98), acid (pH 4–7), and chlorine (1–5 ppm) stresses. After stress treatments, bacterial populations, expression of virulence-associated genes, and Vero-cytotoxicity were determined. Among the strains, O145:NM survived at aw 0.97 longer than other serotypes, while O111:NM was significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress. At pH 4, O103:H1 was more resistant to the stress, while O26:H11 and O111:NM had significantly less growth. For 2 ppm chlorine stress, O26:H11, O103:H1, and O145:NM had higher populations (&gt;3 log) than other strains. Stressed strains showed a significant increase in relative gene expression levels of  *stx1* ,  *stx2* , and  *eae*  in O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM than non-stressed control. Additionally, significantly higher Vero-cytotoxicity, as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase assay, of stressed O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM was observed. The results suggest that the growth and cytotoxicity of selected pathogenic  *E. coli*  may be enhanced after being exposed to environmental stresses.


## Introduction

Shiga toxin-producing  *Escherichia coli*  (STEC) cause severe foodborne illnesses, with patient outcomes including bloody diarrhoea, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and death. Among serotypes of STEC,  *E. coli*  O157:H7 draws the major attention because it has been implicated in more foodborne illness outbreaks than other serotypes. In recent years, increasing awareness of non-O157 STEC as causes of human illness has prompted expanded clinical diagnosis, investigation, and surveillance of these organisms (Gould  *et al* ., 2013). In addition, more than 380 other serotypes of STEC have been isolated from humans (Karmali  *et al* ., 2010). Six  *E. coli*  O groups comprising 13 serotypes have been known to be responsible for over 70% of non-O157 STEC infections in the USA in the period between 1983 and 2002 (Brooks  *et al* ., 2005). Strains of non-O157 STEC cause illnesses similar to those caused by O157 STEC, and the virulence is associated with the presence of virulence genes such as  *stx* 1 or  *stx* 2 (Shiga toxin),  *eae*  (intimin),  *hly*  (enterohemolysin),  *nle*  [non-locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded effector protein],  *saa*  (STEC auto-agglutinating adhesion), and  *subAB*  (subtilase cytotoxin) (Paton et al., 2004; Mingle  *et al* ., 2012). These virulence gene profiles have been successfully revealed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Monaghan  *et al* ., 2011). Of the several virulence factors involved in pathogenicity, Shiga toxin plays a major role in causing severe illnesses in humans (Thorpe, 2004). The Stx family is comprised of Stx1 and Stx2. Stx1 is highly homogeneous, while Stx2 has several variants (Ju  *et al* ., 2012). Both Stx1 and Stx2 are enterotoxic in the intestinal segment model leading to death in mice and rabbits and are cytotoxic to various cell culture models. Cytotoxicity assays have been developed to measure the viability of mammalian cells based on cell proliferation or death. One parameter in evaluating cell death is the integrity of the cell membrane, which can be measured by the cytoplasmic enzyme activity released by damaged cells. Vero cell cytotoxicity assay has been used for the diagnosis of STEC infection (Paton and Paton, 2003). Vero cells have a high concentration of Gb3 receptors on their plasma membranes as well as Gb4 (the preferred receptor for Stx2e) and thus are highly sensitive to all known Stx variants.

Food manufacturing process is designed to interfere with bacterial homeostasis through inactivation of the bacteria by exposure to adverse conditions. It has been known that STEC responds to sub-lethal environmental stresses (Montet  *et al* ., 2009). A number of sub-lethal processing stresses that bacteria may experience during food processing including osmotic stress, mildly acidic environment, and chlorine treatment may enable their survival at the subsequent processing and adverse environmental conditions and upregulation of the virulence-associated genes (Williams et al., 2000; House  *et al* ., 2009). In other words, bacteria recovering or recovered from sub-lethal stresses may exhibit altered expression of virulence-associated genes as a result of injury repair (Price et al., 2000; Olesen and Jespersen, 2010).

Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) dissolved in water is widely used in the food industry to sanitize equipment and reduce microbial contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables (Erkmen, 2010; Althaus  *et al* ., 2012). Microorganisms previously exposed to chlorine treatment may survive and be ingested by consumers. Based on recent whole-genome microarrays for  *E. coli*  O157:H7 strains linked to two foodborne illness outbreaks caused by fresh produce—Sakai, a clinical isolate from the 1996 sprout outbreak in Japan (Michino  *et al* ., 1999), and TW14359, an isolate from the 2006 spinach outbreak in the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006)—a total of 240 genes in Sakai and 140 genes in TW14359 were found to be differentially regulated (Deng  *et al* ., 2011). Despite several transcriptomic analyses, none of the studies revealed that sub-lethal chlorine stress might alter the virulence of pathogenic  *E. coli* . Moreover, although non-O157 STEC have been increasingly identified as clinically significant, there is a lack of information as to how non-O157 STEC responds to stress and the effect of stress on the cytotoxicity, which may be an indication of the levels of Shiga-toxin production and virulence. The purpose of this study was to address if there is any quantitative change in Shiga toxin production by non-O157 STEC under specified stress conditions as determined by Vero-cytotoxicity assays.

## Materials and Methods

### STEC strains

Six  *E. coli*  non-O157 strains—O26:H11 (05-6544), O103:H1 (04/62), O104:H4 (2009EL-2050), O111:NM (98–8338), O121:NM (03-406), and O145:NM (03-4699)—were kindly provided by Dr. Pina Fratamico (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Services, Wyndmoor, PA).  *E. coli*  O157:H7 strains of ATCC 43888, 43889, and 43890 were used as a cocktail mix. Each strain was grown overnight in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD) at 37°C on a shaker with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic growth (~108 CFU/ml).

### Osmotic stress

Stock solutions of various water activities were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment by using 8.5, 7, 5.25, and 3.5 g of NaCl (Mallinckrodt Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) to obtain different levels of water activities (aw 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.98) in 100 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Biosciences). Water activity was measured using an AquaLab water activity metre (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) calibrated with saturated salt solutions of known water activity. Ten millilitres of the overnight  *E. coli*  cell suspension cultures was pelleted (2800 ×  *g* , 2 min, 4°C), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and diluted in sterile distilled water (DW) to a final concentration of ~103 CFU/ml. Samples were incubated at 22°C and samplings were performed after incubation for 7, 14, and 21 days. At each sampling point, 1 ml of cell suspension was removed and serially diluted in PBS. The cell counts were determined by plating 0.1 ml of solution onto tryptic soy agar (TSA; BD Biosciences) plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h, and the typical colonies were counted.

### Acidic stress

TSB was acidified to pH 7, 6, 5, or 4 using 1 N hydrochloric acid (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). The acidified TSB was sterilized using 0.22-µm Corning filter units (Costar, Corning, NY).  *E. coli*  cells were inoculated separately into each of the prepared acidified PBS solutions (10 ml) to achieve a final cell concentration of ca. 103CFU/ml. The inoculated broth was incubated at 22°C for 21 d. Samples were drawn after incubation for 7, 14, and 21 days. At each sampling point, 1 ml of each cell suspension was serially diluted in PBS. Three appropriate dilutions (0.1 ml) of each tested sample were plated on duplicate TSA plates. The inoculated plates were incubated for 24–48 h at 37°C before colonies were counted.

### Chlorine stress

Stock solutions of NaOCl were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment by diluting 5% NaOCl (Fisher Scientific) in sterile distilled water (22°C) to give various concentrations of NaOCl. Each strain of STEC at 8 log CFU/ml was exposed to NaOCl (1, 2, and 5 ppm) at 22°C for 24 h. Ten millilitres of STEC cell suspension cultures grown overnight at 37°C was pelleted (2800 ×  *g* , 2 min, 4°C), washed twice with PBS, and diluted in chlorinated distilled water to a final concentration of ~107 CFU/ml. During incubation in chlorinated distilled water for 24 h, 1 ml of liquid from each tube was immediately transferred to test tubes containing PBS and filter-sterilized neutralizing reagent (2 µg/ml of sodium thiosulfate, Fisher Scientific) at each sampling period (1, 6, and 24 h). The cells after the treatments were enumerated by plating 0.1 ml of solution onto TSA agar plates and incubating at 37°C for 24 h. The STEC cells surviving the exposure of 2 ppm chlorine for 24 h were collected and subjected to chlorine exposure treatment for 24 h. After four consecutive exposures, the fourth generation of each chlorine-stressed STEC cells (G3) and each generation (G0, G1, G2, and G3) was stored and frozen until they were used for cytotoxicity assays.

### Quantification of virulence-associated genes

One millilitre of the bacterial cells grown overnight at 37°C was harvested by centrifugation at 17 900 ×  *g*  for 3 min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was subjected to bacterial RNA isolation using RiboPure™-Bacteria Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted using TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8). The concentration of RNA was evaluated by the absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm using the Nanodrop® ND100 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). DNase I was treated according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to cDNA synthesis to avoid residual DNA contamination.

RNA (2 µg) was subsequently used to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cDNA (10 ng) was added to 25 µl PCR reaction mixture containing 2x Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and 250 nM of each primer ( *stx* 1,  *stx* 2,  *eae* , and  *mdh* ). PCR for  *stx* 1,  *stx* 2,  *eae* , and  *mdh*  genes was carried out using the primer pairs (Fratamico  *et al* ., 2011) as described in Table 1. PCR samples were amplified using a 7500 Fast RT-PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) at a cycle of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, then 55°C for 1 min. Non-DNA templates were included as negative controls for PCR reaction. The housekeeping gene  *mdh*  was used as an internal control to normalize the  *Ct* (threshold cycle) values of  *stx1* ,  *stx2* , and  *eae* . The relative expression of these virulence genes in stressed cells was calculated by normalizing to the expression level of corresponding genes in control cells. The Δ *Ct* , ΔΔ *Ct* , and the 2ˉfx values were calculated as described by Pfaffl (2001).

### Vero-cytotoxicity assays

Cytotoxicity was determined using Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81, African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used to quantify cell death based on the measurement of LDH released from the cytosol of damaged cells into the extracellular media. LDH is a stable cytoplasmic enzyme present inside the cytosol of all types of bacterial cells. It is released to the extracellular space when the plasma membrane is damaged (Korzeniewski and Callewaert, 1983). The LDH activity is determined by a two-step enzymatic test. The first step is the reduction of NAD+ to NADH/H+ by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In a second step, the catalyst (diaphorase) transfers H/H+ from NADH/H+ to the tetrazolium salt 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride, which is reduced to a red formazan (Lappalainen  *et al* ., 1994). For assays, monolayer of subconfluent Vero cells in 96-well plates was seeded in 96-well plates. STEC cells (G3 or control) grown overnight under regular BHI broth at late exponential or early stationary phase were collected and filter-sterilized to obtain supernatants including Shiga toxin released to extracellular media. Vero cells were exposed to filter-sterilized supernatants for 24 h or up to 48 h at 37°C in 5% CO2incubator. After incubation, the release of LDH was measured using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The spontaneous LDH release (=low control) was determined by adding 100 µl of assay medium that contains 1% foetal bovine serum without pyruvate to wells containing 100 µl of cells in assay medium. Maximum LDH release (=high control) was determined by adding 100 µl of Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution (2% Triton X-100 in assay medium) to each well containing 100 μl of cells in assay medium. The amount of LDH released was determined by transferring 100 µl of supernatant from each well to wells of optically clear 96-well, flat-bottomed microplates (Corning), adding 100 µl of reaction mixture to wells, incubating at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and measuring absorption at 492 nm using a reference wavelength of 620 nm with Saffire2 microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC). In the cytotoxicity LDH detection assay, the percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated using optical density readings:

 

Cytotoxicity(%)=[(experiment value–low control)/(high control–low control)]×100Cytotoxicity(%)=[(experiment value–low control)/(high control–low control)]×100

Measured cytotoxicity was normalized by the cell population when the supernatants were collected. Each sample was tested in triplicates. At least three independent experiments were performed for each sample.

### Statistical analysis

Each experiment was conducted in duplicate and repeated three times. Data collected from the study were analysed using the Student’s  *t* -test of the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Significance of differences in survival among the tested STEC strains under various treatments was determined at α = 0.05.

## Results and Discussion

### Survival under osmotic stress

The populations of three strain cocktails of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 and six strains of non-O157 STEC (O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, O111:NM, O121:NM, and O145:NM) subjected to four different levels of osmotic stresses (aw 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.98) at 22°C for 3 weeks are shown in Figure 1A. Most foods have water activity of 0.95 or above and aw 0.99 was not included in this experiment because of similar outcome to control in growth. At aw 0.95 and 0.96, all tested strains fell to undetectable levels with little variation after a week of incubation. At aw 0.97, 7.6 log CFU/ml of  *E. coli*  O145:NM strain survived the osmotic stress during 21 days of incubation, while the other strains were not detected after one week.  *E. coli*  O111:NM was most sensitive to osmotic stress; even at aw 0.98, it did not endure the osmolarity for 7 days. The other strains showed similar growth for 21 days. Previous studies (Baylis  *et al* ., 2004; Hiramatsu  *et al* ., 2005) have shown that  *E. coli*  O157 and non-O157 STEC strains had similar growth patterns under osmotic stresses. In our study, most of non-O157 and O157 STEC showed similar patterns of growth, which is consistent with previous findings except for  *E. coli*  O145:NM, which exhibited significantly higher growth at aw 0.97 when compared with other strains. It was suggested that an increase in environmental osmotic pressure disrupts metabolic activities by losing water to the exterior, which leads to the breakage of STEC cell membrane (Beney  *et al* ., 2004; Yoo and Chen, 2010).

### Survival under acidic stress

Seven STEC strains at initial bacterial populations of 3 log CFU/ml were exposed to four different levels of pH (4, 5, 6, and 7) at 22°C for 3 weeks (Figure 1B). Foods associated with recent outbreaks including tomatoes (pH 4–5), ground beef (pH 5–6), Romaine lettuce (pH 6), and spinach (pH 6–7) were considered to choose different levels of pHs. At pH 4, most strains did not survive after 7 days, while 2.2 log CFU/ml of  *E. coli*  O103:H1 survived after 7 days and 1.8 log CFU/ml remained after 14 days. Over pH 5, most strains did not show any difficulty in growth, where  *E. coli* O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O111:NM had significantly ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) less growth than other strains during the first week. Acidic stress is a stress that STEC may be exposed to in the environment, during food processing, or in food matrices. Typically, different organic acids including benzoate, sorbate, propionate, and citrate are present in combination with mild acidic conditions (pH 4–7). Survival of STEC under the influence of pH was investigated mainly due to the inherent resistance of STEC. Exposed to simulating gastric acidity,  *E. coli*  O157 was shown to be more resistant to acidic conditions than non-O157 STEC such as  *E. coli*  O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O111:H8 (Bergholz and Whittam, 2007), which is consistent with our results that these two strains had significantly less growth than other strains at pH 5 in the first week of exposure.

### Survival after chlorine stress

After STEC cells at 8 log CFU/ml were exposed to NaOCl (1, 2, and 5 ppm) at 22°C for 24 h, the survivor curve of each strain was plotted and compared using Student’s  *t* -test (Figure 2A). There were significant differences ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) in the surviving populations of STEC during chlorine exposures. Significantly higher populations were observed for  *E. coli*  O26:H11,  *E. coli*  O103:H1,  *E. coli*  O104:H4, and  *E. coli*  O145:NM strains than others including  *E. coli*  O157:H7 under 2 ppm of NaOCl. The populations of  *E. coli*  O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O103:H1 were 6.1 and 5.6 log CFU/ml, respectively, while other strains were less than 3 log CFU/ml after 24 h. For 1 ppm of chlorine treatment,  *E. coli*  O104:H4 showed significantly the highest survival among the strains ( *P*  &lt; 0.05). After 24 h of exposure, cells were washed by PBS, collected, and repeatedly exposed to chlorine. The STEC strains were designated as G0, G1, G2, and G3according the number (1–4) of exposure to chlorine stresses. To address the acquired resistance after sub-lethal stress, stressed STEC strains from each generation were exposed to 2 ppm of chlorine for 48 h (Figure 2B). The fourth generation (G3) of each strain showed significantly ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) higher survival rate than other generations except for  *E. coli*  O111: NM and  *E. coli*  O121:NM, indicating that G3 is relatively most resistant to sub-lethal chlorine. Activity of chlorine can strictly depend on the matrix where there is other organic material available in the environment. However, we assume that the surface of the equipments in food processing facilities has been taken care of by sanitation and cleaning procedure required by the pre-requisite program accompanying Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point. Some STEC may endure those procedures and remain on the surface where organic matter is absent. Among the intervention strategies to mitigate STEC risk in food production, chlorine is widely used as a washing or sanitizing agent. In this study, the chlorine stress conditions simulate the conditions that the STEC may encounter during food production or in the processing environment. Consecutive exposures of surviving  *E. coli*  O157:H7 to sub-lethal amounts of chlorine may induce expression of  *ycfR* , which is involved in the response to chlorine stress (Hou  *et al* ., 2013). It promotes attachment and colonization of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 in lettuce and leads to better growth. In other studies,  *ycfR*  was upregulated by tenfold under chlorine treatment (Zhang et al., 2007; Mermod  *et al* ., 2012). Under chlorine stress, this gene has been shown to be involved in the surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation (Gonzalez-Escobedo and Gunn, 2013). This gene was also known to contribute to surface attachment and survival of  *Salmonella enterica*  during post-harvest minimal processing of fresh produce (Salazar  *et al* ., 2013).

### Effect of stresses on the relative expression of virulence-associated genes

Several virulence-associated genes in STEC have been identified (Kaper  *et al* ., 2004). Among them,  *stx* 1,  *stx* 2, and  *eae*  have been selected to investigate the effects of chlorine stresses on the relative expression of these genes by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3A, consecutive sub-lethal chlorine treatment against O103:H1, O104:H4, O145:NM, and O157:H7 resulted in significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase (&gt;1.4 fold) in relative gene expression of  *stx* 1 compared to control cells. Similarly, chlorine-stressed cells of O103:H1 showed significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase (&gt;2 fold) in relative gene expression of  *stx* 2 compared to control cells, and cells of O104:H4 and O145:NM showed slight increase (1.27–1.38 fold), while O26:H11 showed large increase (1.92 fold) in  *stx2*  (Figure 3B). On the other hand, chlorine-stressed cells of O111: NM, O121:NM, and O157:H7 showed similar or slightly less expression of selected genes when compared to control cells. Relative gene expression of  *eae*  was mostly similar to the patterns in  *stx1*  and  *stx2* , except for stressed cells of O111: NM with twofold increases in  *eae*  compared to control cells (Figure 3C). Studies have reported that the expression of virulence-associated genes is connected to better survival or growth of STEC in fresh produce. Robinson  *et al* . (2006) suggested that the  *stx* 2 mutant of a STEC strain was less effective in adherence to epithelial cells than its wild-type counterpart. In addition, the mutant revealed a lower capacity to colonize mouse intestine, indicating that Shiga toxin promotes intestinal colonization, possibly also in humans. However, Sheng  *et al* . (2006) proposed that  *E. coli*  O157:H7 requires the presence of intimin, Tir, and pO157 to colonize cattle at the terminus of rectal mucosa, while the colonization preceded normally in the absence of the active  *stx* genes (Los  *et al* ., 2012). When the pathogen has abrupt shifting in its environment, it induces a package of stress response genes. A recent study (Kocharunchitt  *et al* ., 2014) showed that sudden downshift of aw induced global changes in growth kinetics, nutrient metabolism, cell structure components, and general stress response as well as virulence properties. Changes in relative transcriptional level of virulence-associated genes may be dependent on the general stress response to chlorine stress. Our findings suggest that chlorine stress may induce the expression of virulence-associated genes through potential mechanisms by stress response genes.

### Effect of stresses on the cytotoxicity in Vero cells

Filtered supernatant samples from stressed (G3) and control STEC cells were tested for the presence of Shiga toxin using the LDH assay. Vero-cytotoxicity increased over time in control and stressed cells, indicating time dependence of toxin production (Figure 4A). The cytotoxicity peaked after 24 h of growth in both stressed and control cells except for  *E. coli*  O103:H1, with the highest production observed at 36 h for control cells and 48 h for stressed cells during incubation. Therefore, a 24-h growth was chosen for experiments. To address the difference in the cytotoxicity between stressed and control cells, supernatant samples from both groups were collected after 24 h of growth and assayed for Vero-cytotoxicity (Figure 4B). There was significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase in cytotoxicity (%) between stressed and control cells in  *E. coli*  O26:H11 (40%),  *E. coli*  O103:H1 (50%),  *E. coli*  O104:H4 (60%), and  *E. coli* O145:NM (25%). Stressed  *E. coli*  O157:H7 cells also showed an increase in cytotoxicity compared to control cells, but this increase was not statistically significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05). It was noted that supernatants from stressed and control cells showed an increase in Vero-cytotoxicity over time for the first 24 h. It seems that the damaged cell membrane may enable more toxin release while minimizing the wound of cytosolic organs. An investigation of bacterial recovery from 5-day starvation and chlorine treatment showed that there was no difference between control and stressed STEC in Vero-cytotoxicity (Kolling and Matthews, 2007). The main reason for STECs to produce Shiga toxin might be to protect themselves from either predators or hostile mammalian immunological system (Los  *et al* ., 2012). A similar outcome was shown in a study where  *Campylobacter jejuni*  injured by sub-lethal exposure to chlorine showed a low invasive potential for HeLa cells (Terzieva and McFeters, 1992). In contrast, a virulence study based on mouse LD50, adhesion, and invasion assays conducted in  *Yersinia enterocolitica* ,  *Salmonella typhimurium* , and enterotoxigenic  *E. coli*  showed that the chlorine treatment weakened their virulence (LeChevallier  *et al* ., 1985). Increased release of Shiga toxin production by STEC may benefit the organisms by providing protective barriers to defend themselves against the hosts’ immune systems and prolong the life span of invading microorganisms. Transcriptomic responses of  *Salmonella enteritidis*  and  *S* .  *typhimurium*  to chlorine stress revealed that half of the genes in  *Salmonella*  pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 were downregulated in  *S. typhimurium*  under chlorine treatments, suggesting that chlorine stress may affect the biosynthesis and assembly of type III secretion system leading to reduced virulence in  *S. typhimurium* , while no significant change in the expression of genes in SPI was seen in  *S. enteritidis*  under the same condition (Wang  *et al* ., 2010). Additionally, osmotic stress by the use of salt in meat processing enhanced the production of Shiga toxin based on qRT-PCR and Western blot (Harris  *et al* ., 2012). Lee  *et al* . (2012) suggested that strains which have different genotypes ( *stx1* ,  *stx2* , or both) may respond distinctly to the same stress. They showed that a strain with greater resistance to one type of stress tended to have greater resistance to the other types of stresses. In the present study, the result of higher expression of  *stx1*  or  *stx2* in stressed O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM agrees with their findings. In this study, a cocktail mix of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 consisting of strain 43888 (lack of  *stx1*  and  *stx2* ), 43889 ( *stx2* -positive), and 43890 ( *stx1* -positive) (Jothikumar and Griffiths, 2002) was used as a control to normalize the relative contribution of each toxin to cytotoxic effect in Vero cell culture. It seemed to have contributed to a larger variation of cytotoxicity in control cells of O157:H7 (Figure 4). The relative abundance of  *stx1*  and  *stx2* , or  *eae*  in stressed non-O157 STECs of selected strains may enhance the Vero-cytotoxicity in those cells when compared with those of unstressed control cells.

## Conclusions

In this study, we compared the level of cytotoxicity between unstressed and stressed STEC. Results suggest that repetitive exposure of STEC to sub-lethal chlorine treatment may enhance the levels of Vero-cytotoxicity in STEC O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM which may lead to an increased virulence. It was supported by the increased expression of virulence-associated genes in STEC O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM. We assume that sub-lethal chlorine treatment may bring about more risks in terms of cytotoxicity. However, to better assess the potential risks, profound biochemical experiments will be needed to sophisticatedly address the factors involved in the release of Shiga toxin and the increase in the expression of virulence-associated genes.

Food shelf-life extension is important not only to food manufacturers, but also to home refrigeration/freezing appliance companies, whose products affect food quality and food waste. While freezing and refrigerating both extend the shelf life of foods, food quality deterioration continues regardless of the preservation method. This review article discusses the global fish market, the composition of fish meat, and the effects of freezing and thawing on salmon quality.

UPDATE questions SET content = '#### Abstract

The food additive named polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and identified with the code E-476 (PGPR) is used as emulsifier in tin-greasing emulsions for the baking trade and for the production of low-fat spreads. However, the main application of PGPR is in the chocolate industry, where, besides its action as an emulsifier, it also has important properties as a viscosity modifier and thus improves the moulding properties of the molten chocolate. An additional property of PGPR in chocolate is its ability to limit fat bloom. Known chemical methods for preparing this emulsifier involve long reaction times and high operating temperatures, which adversely affect the quality of the final product leading to problems of coloration and odors that could make it inadvisable for the food industry. As an alternative, the enzymatic synthesis of PGPR by the catalytic action of two lipases has been developed. The enzymes act in mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure, neutral pH, and in a solvent-free system, which makes the process environmentally friendly and avoids side reaction, so that the product has a higher purity and quality.

#### 1. Food Additives

Food additives have been developed over the years to meet the needs of food production, as making foods on a large scale is a very different task to making them in the kitchen at home. Additives are needed to ensure processed food remains in a good condition throughout its journey from the factory to the shop and to the consumer at home. Some are so essential that they are even used in organic foods [[1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B1)–[3](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B3)].

In the broadest of terms, food additives are substances intentionally added to food either directly or indirectly with one or more of the following purposes [[4](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B4)]:(1)to maintain or improve nutritional quality;(2)to maintain product quality and freshness;(3)to aid in the processing or preparation of food;(4)to make food more appealing.

On the other hand, food additives may only be authorized if [[4](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B4)](1)there is a technological need for their use;(2)they do not mislead the consumer;(3)they present no hazard to the health of the consumer.

The use of food additives must always be labelled on the packaging of food products by their category (antioxidant, preservative, colour, etc.) with either their name or E number. In the United States, food additives are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Two sections of the regulations govern their use: substances affirmed as GRAS, that is, Generally Recognized as Safe, (21CFR184) and Direct Food Additives (21CFR172). Substances that have been affirmed as GRAS usually have less stringent regulations attached to their use. However, Food and Drug Administration Standards of Identity may preclude their use in certain standardized foods. In comparison, Direct Food Additives may be allowed only in certain specific foods at low maximum allowable levels. The method of manufacture and analytical constants may also be defined.

The European Community (EC) regulates food emulsifiers in an analogous fashion to United States regulations, identifying the additives with E numbers. Specific regulations, however, must be consulted before food products are designed for international markets. For example, polyglycerol esters up to a degree of polymerization of 10 are widely accepted in the United States. For the EC, this value may not exceed 4. Standards of Identity may also differ significantly. Other countries, which have not formed trading communities, may have regulations, which are unique [[5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B5)–[7](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B7)].

The food additive functional classes are based on the Codex Class Names and the International Numbering System (INS) for Food Additives (CAC/GL 36-1989). There are four general categories of food additives: nutritional additives, processing agents, preservatives, and sensory agents. These are not strict classifications, as many additives fall into more than one category [[8](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B8)].(1) *Nutritional additives.*  They are utilized for the purpose of restoring nutrients lost or degraded during production, fortifying or enriching certain foods in order to correct dietary deficiencies or adding nutrients to food substitutes.(2) *Processing agents.*  These additives are added to foods in order to aid in processing or to maintain the desired consistency of the product.(3) *Preservatives.*  They are classified into two main groups: antioxidants (compounds that delay or prevent the deterioration of foods by oxidative mechanisms) and antimicrobials (inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food).(4) *Sensory agents.*  Such as colorants (natural or synthetics), flavorings, and sweeteners.

Kitchen sponges are among the possible sources of contaminants in food establishments. The main purpose of the current study was, therefore, to assess the microbiological safety of sponges as it has been used in selected food establishments of Jimma town. 

Accordingly, the microbiological safety of a total of 201 kitchen sponges randomly collected from food establishments was evaluated against the total counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and molds. The mean counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged from 7.43 to 12.44 log CFU/mm3. The isolated genera were dominated by  *Pseudomonas* (16.9%),  *Bacillus*  (11.1%),  *Micrococcus*  (10.6%),  *Streptococcus*  (7.8%), and  *Lactobacillus*  (6%) excluding the unidentified Gram positive rods (4.9%) and Gram negative rods (9.9%). 

The high microbial counts (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, and yeast and molds) reveal the existence of poor kitchen sponge sanitization practice. Awareness creation training on basic hygienic practices to food handlers and periodic change of kitchen sponges are recommended.

Peeled shrimps were dried separately using an air-oven dryer and a tunnel solar dryer. The drying profile of shrimp meat was determined in the two drying systems by monitoring moisture loss over the drying period. 

Changes in color, proximate composition, and rehydration capacity were assessed. The rate of moisture removal during solar drying was faster than the air-oven drying. 


The development of red color during drying was comparable among the two methods, but solar-dried shrimps appeared darker () than the air-oven-dried (). Chemical analysis indicated that protein and fat made up nearly 20% and 2% (wb) of the shrimp meat, respectively. 

Protein and ash content of shrimp meat dried under the two dryer types were comparable but fat was significantly () higher in oven-dried meat (2.1%), compared to solar-dried meat (1.5%). Although rehydration behavior of shrimp from the two drying systems followed a similar pattern, solar-dried shrimp absorbed moisture more rapidly. 

The results have demonstrated that different approaches to drying may affect the physical and nutritional quality of shrimp meat differently.

ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 16140-1: 2016 methods of microbial assays were done to determine the presence of aerobes, coliforms, E.coli and fungi. Statistical analysis was carried out using the GraphPad Prism 5. The results indicated that moisture content of the honeys ranged from 14.46%-22.31%. The pH values were within the acidity range (4.1-4.3), whiles water insoluble solids ranged from 0.56% to 8.50%; sucrose level ranged from 2.64%-3.12%, but the pressed honey had the highest glucose+fructose (90%). There was significant differences (p<0.05) in the microbial quality of the honeys from the two districts, and under the different treatments. Cold extracted honeys recorded the highest bacterial count of 4.614 × 103 cfu/g, honey from pressed method had the least count of 3.30 × 102 cfu/g. Food pathogens were not detected. Aerobes were within safe limits; hence, these honeys were classified as safe for consumption. The results indicated that the best mode of honey extraction was by honey press. All the detected counts fell within the acceptable limits. The study concluded that generally, honey produced locally is safe for consumption.

Donkey milk can be used as a substitute for infants and children who suffer from cow milk proteins intolerance and multiple food hypersensitivity. Up to date, this is one of the main reasons why donkey milk has become a substantial area for reasearch, with an increase over the the last fifteen years. 

In donkey milk chain, risk analysis should be the object of particular attention because children are the main consumers of this food. In fact, this process is one of the main tool to achieve a high level of protection of human health and life; thus, the most important safety hazards should be monitored in order to attain this goal. 

This review focuses on the main hazards possibly present in raw donkey milk, including bacteria, fungal toxins, parasites, and chemical pollutants. Literature data have been considered, including some information that is not provided in the international literature. In the authors’ opinion, the current scientific knowledge should be improved, with the aim of allowing a suitable risk assessment along the whole donkey milk chain. 

However, in the meantime, the competent authorities must carry out more stringent official controls, with particular attention given to the level of primary production. The issue of a traceability system in donkey milk chain should be considered of paramount importance.

It is common practice for many athletes and active adults to use protein supplements to enhance gains in lean muscle mass, and whey protein, in particular, is ideal due to its high levels of essential amino acids. Whey protein isolates, one of the most common forms of protein, are considered one of the best sources of protein available.

To date, no studies have examined the relative performance of whey protein that has undergone the patent-pending Ingredient Optimized process in order to enhance its effects on muscle protein synthesis and lean muscle anabolism. 

As such, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relative benefit of this ioProtein whey protein isolate, in combination with resistance exercise, on several measures of body composition among a sample of athletes in comparison with those associated with an untreated whey protein isolate.



 Twenty healthy male and female adults, between the ages of 18 and 37 years, were recruited. Results indicated that individuals who supplemented with the Ingredient Optimized whey protein saw a significant improvement in fat-free mass (p<0.5) compared to those taking non-optimized, non-treated whey protein. 

Moreover, individuals supplementing with Ingredient Optimized whey protein also experienced significantly enhanced performance on bench press (p<0.5), squat (p<0.5), recovery time (p<0.5), and stomach discomfort (p<0.5), which was not reported from individuals taking the non-optimized control whey protein.

UPDATE questions SET content = 'In many countries where milk production is high, a significant amount of milk is used for cheese production. The most important factor determining the yield and quality of cheese in cheese making is the coagulation property of milk. For this reason, coagulation of milk with rennet, which is the basis of cheese production for the dairy industry, is of great importance. The coagulation of casein micelles forms the basis of cheese making. Coagulation occurs in two different ways, usually with acid and enzyme. In both methods, casein changes to insoluble form and forms a non-degradable network structure. In acid coagulation, the protein network is loose, whereas in enzyme coagulation, the protein network is tight and elastic.

a) Coagulation of Casein by Acid Effect

During acidification, different biochemical changes are observed in casein micelles. These changes are demineralization of casein micelles, protonation of acid groups, decrease in solubility, hydration of caseins and zeta potential. These successive events cause precipitation of caseins if acidification is rapid and gelation if acidification is slow.

Casein micelles are very sensitive to pH changes. As an increase in the amount of lactic acid in milk, Colloidal Calcium Phosphate, an important building block of casein complex, dissolves away from the structure. Degradation of casein micelles is considered to be caused by differentiation of the surface of micelles. Increased acidity causes the coagulation by neutralizing the negative charge on the micelle surface.

The easiest clotting of casein occurs at pH 4.6. This pH is the isoelectric point of casein. At this point, the positive and negative electrical charges of the caseins are equal.

Heat treatment also has an effect on the coagulation of casein with acid effect. Denaturing serum proteins by heat treatment create--casein and S-S bridges, reducing electrostatic and steric repulsion, resulting in higher pH coagulation of caseins.

b) Coagulation of Casein by Enzymatic Effect

Proteolytic enzymes from some plant, animal and microbial sources coagulate casein. All of these enzymes belong to the group of acid proteases. In particular, one of the animal proteases rennet (chymosin) enzyme is used in cheese technology.

Coagulation of casein micelles by the effect of chymosin enzyme; (a) enzymatic proteolysis, (b) aggregation (agglomeration), and (c ) gelling.' WHERE id = 1011;

**Abstract**

Olive oil, and especially virgin olive oil (VOO) and extra VOO, has great interest worldwide because of its unique fatty acid profile, phenolic compounds with positive health properties for the human health and appreciated aroma profile.

However, the composition of VOO can change dramatically depending on the olive variety, field management, olive fruit maturity degree, harvesting and processing, which can affect its final characteristic flavour. At industrial level, the extraction conditions applied can affect the concentration and composition of phenolic and volatile compounds, with possible negative consequence and the formation of off-flavours. Olive crushing, malaxation, centrifugation, filtration and storage were reported to be all possible factors affecting VOO flavour.

The present review paper describes the factors affecting the virgin olive oils composition, with a focus on the aroma compounds, biophenols and the resulting sensory profile. A particular focus was put on the volatile and phenolic compounds and their relation with the sensory description and impact of the final flavour. In conclusion, many factors still need to be studied to fully understand the complex composition and interactions of this appreciated product. This information is also relevant and useful both for scientific knowledge and for its industrial application, as producers can modulate the final characteristics of the VOO.
