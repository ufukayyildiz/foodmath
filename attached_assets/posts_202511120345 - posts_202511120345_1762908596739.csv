Cow and its products were not originally from the Middle East region which relied mainly on goat for the milk and sheep for the meat.
Bovine were introduced as a cheaper and more versatile alternative that could be easily industralized in a region still not ready for the fresh liquid milk. That's where powder milk entered a market looking for long lasting product life with no need for refrigeration.
Recently, there was a high demand for goat products from people with lactose intolerance, indigestion, allergies and when they knew that almond milk was not really milk.
Last year i asked one goat farmer about the possibility of producing goat powder milk, he bluntly said ""we don't produce enough milk to do that"""

1614,1,"Introduction
Microorganisms contaminate foods causing food spoilage and poisoning. Therefore, inactivation or inhibition of undesirable microorganisms in food is important to assure safety of foods . Debeaufort and Voilley indicate that the qualities of food products are associated with their organoleptic, nutritional and microbiological properties which change during storage. Such changes are caused by interactions between foods and their surrounding environment or by migration between different components within composite food . 

Various methods can eliminate or reduce microorganisms on food products but many of these techniques cause chemical and physical changes of food products. Many studies have focused on the improvement of antimicrobial active systems through fusion of antimicrobial substances onto the food coatings . Bourtoom write that biocomposites have received significant attention in recent years by reason of their advantages over synthetic films .

 Janjarasskul and Krochta notice that it is the result of increasing demand for safe, high-quality foods with long shelf life and the awareness that biodegradable protective coatings help in reducing packaging waste . Film and coating are used to identify a material or composition that covers a food surface. However, according to Pavlath and Orts the difference between film and coating is that film is a stand-alone wrapping material, while a coating is created directly on food surface itself . As discussed by Sánchez-Ortega et al. edible films are produced from food grade filmogenic suspensions. Films may take the form of pouches, capsules, casings, wraps or bags. Akhtara et al. show that many edible films prevent moisture losses and quality changes, additionally described films help in control exchange of various gases which appearing in respiration processes. Such biocomposites also prevent loss of different quality components of food product and ensure surface resistance . Šuput et al. indicates that biodegradable polymers should be degraded by microorganisms in composting processes to produce natural breakdown compounds. 

Edible packaging can be carriers for flavourings, antimicrobial agents or antioxidants, etc. . The coating/film should also ensure sterility of the food surface, therefore antimicrobial biocomposites can be a promising method for providing food safety through preventing pathogens contamination by direct contact of the package with its surface. Successive release of antibacterial substance from the surface coating of the product for a longer period of time seems to be more important than the use of antimicrobial agents in food products. However, even if the coating possesses an antimicrobial effect, other qualities such as sensory properties may change, causing the product to be unacceptable to consumers.

1413,1,"**Abstract**
Ripening is a genetically programmed highly coordinated irreversible phenomenon which includes many biochemical changes including tissue softening, pigment changes, aroma and flavour volatile production, reduction in astringency, and many others. Banana is one of mostly consumed fruit crops in the world. Since banana is a climactic fruit, induced ripening is essential in commercial scale banana cultivation and distribution to assure good flavour, texture, and uniform peel colour.

Ethylene gas, acetylene gas liberated from calcium carbide, and ethephon are some of the commercial ripening agents used successfully in the trade and they have been widely studied for their effectiveness on initiating and accelerating the ripening process and their effect on fruit quality and health related issues. Lauryl alcohol was also shown as a ripening agent for bananas. Most studies suggest that there is no difference in biochemical composition and sensory quality in bananas treated with chemicals that induce ripening from naturally ripened bananas. However volatile profiles of artificially ripened bananas were shown to be considerably different from naturally ripened bananas in some studies. This review discusses induced ripening agents and their effect on fruit quality of bananas.

Complementary equations have also been included to describe fermentation kinetics, based on Monod equation with additional terms accounting for inhibition effects linked to the substrate, products, and biomass. In this chapter, a reasonable number of unstructured kinetic models of 1‐G ethanol fermentations have been compiled and reviewed. Segregated models, as regards the physiological state of the biomass (cell viability), have also been reviewed, and it was found that some of the analyzed kinetic models are also applied to the modeling of second‐generation ethanol production processes.

14272,1,"Probiotics and Prebiotics: What’s the Difference?

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria, and prebiotics is food for these bacteria. Eating foods or supplements containing both can help balance your gut bacteria.

Probiotics and prebiotics are both pretty big topics in nutrition these days. Yet even though they sound similar, the two play different roles in your health.

What are probiotics and prebiotics?
✓Probiotics: These are live bacteria found in certain foods or supplements. They can provide numerous health benefits.

✓Prebiotics: These substances come from types of carbs (mostly fiber) that humans can’t digest. The beneficial bacteria in your gut eat this fiber.
Eating balanced amounts of both probiotics and prebiotics can help ensure that you have the right balance of these bacteria to keep your gut microbiota healthy.

Which foods are prebiotic?
Foods that are high in prebiotic fiber include:
√ legumes, beans, and peas
√ oats
√ bananas
√ berries
√ Jerusalem artichokes (not the same as regular artichokes)
√ asparagus
√ dandelion greens
√ garlic
√ leeks
√ onions

Which foods are probiotic?
There are also many probiotic foods that naturally contain helpful bacteria, such as yogurt.
Examples of fermented foods include:
√ sauerkraut
√ kimchi
√ kombucha tea
√ kefir (dairy and nondairy)
√ some types of pickles (unpasteurized)
√ other pickled vegetables (unpasteurized)"

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of temperature, time, and thickness of tomatoes fruits during adiabatic drying process. Dehydration, a simple and inexpensive process compared to other conservation methods, is widely used in the food industry in order to ensure a long shelf life for the product due to the low water activity. 

This study aimed to obtain the best processing conditions to avoid losses and keep product quality. 

Factorial design and surface response methodology were applied to fit predictive mathematical models. In the dehydration of tomatoes through the adiabatic process, temperature, time, and sample thickness, which greatly contribute to the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of the final product, were evaluated. 

The optimum drying conditions were 60°C with the lowest thickness level and shorter time.

913,1,"Principle 1.2: Conduct a hazard analysis
What does this mean?
For a HACCP plan to be effective, control measures need to be targeted at those hazards which are more likely to occur in practice and which if they occur may lead to actual harm. The process of identifying such significant hazards is known as “Hazard Analysis” and requires you to work through each process step in turn, describing the identified hazards and then ranking them in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and severity. At the end of this process, you will be required to identify suitable control measures for those hazards ranked as significant (see Principle 1.3) but can ignore any hazards which you have ranked as insignificant.
How is this stage achieved?
1.   Write a hazard description for each hazard
MyHACCP will invite you to write a brief description for each of the hazards that you identified in Principle 1.1. The description should refer to the source or cause of the hazard and whilst brief, should contain sufficient detail to properly characterise the hazard. When writing the hazard description you should include one of the following terms which provide an explanation of the nature of the hazards at each process step. Using the same terminology throughout the HACCP plan will help you to produce a coherent plan.
Presence:
Use this description when the hazard is likely to be already present in the food at the process step. For example:
Presence of Salmonella in raw chicken pieces
Presence of E.coli o157 in raw beef mince
Presence of stones in sacks of chick peas
Presence of bones in fish
Introduction:
This description should be used where the hazard is potentially introduced at the process step itself. For example:
Introduction of E.coli o157 by cross-contamination from utensils
Introduction of glass from broken light fittings
Introduction of Listeria from condensate dripping into open food
Growth:
This description should be used where there is potential for growth of microorganisms at a process step. For example:
Growth of Salmonella during ageing process
Growth of Clostridium perfringens during cooling
Growth of moulds during maturing process
Survival:
This description should be used at a process step which will not adequately remove the hazard. For example:
Survival of Clostridium botulinum spores
Survival of Trichenella parasites
Survival of spoilage spore-forming bacteria
So far you have identified a “long list” of hazards and briefly described how they are likely to have arisen in the food. The next task is one of the most important of the HACCP process: the identification of those hazards which are significant and the rejection of those which pose no significant risk to the consumer and can be controlled by your prerequisite programme. The purpose is to produce a “short list” of significant hazards which must be considered further by the HACCP study. This will be achieved by you scoring each of the identified hazards in terms of “Severity” and “Likelihood” to obtain a “Significance” score.
2.   Provide a severity score for each hazard
MyHACCP uses a 1-3 scoring system to specify the severity of each identified hazard, in terms of the potential harm that could be caused to the consumer. A score of 1 indicates low severity of the hazard, and 3 is high severity. You should base your severity score purely on the potential outcome of the hazard remaining in the food at the time it is consumed. Do not consider the likelihood of this happening, as this is covered in the next stage. 
Score 1: Low severity
Here there is little risk of serious harm to the consumer although there might be some concerns regarding the quality of the product. Some examples of low severity issues which may score a “1” here include:
Taints in food where there is no actual chemical contamination;  for example, exposure to diesel exhaust fumes or taints from packaging
Discolouration of food
Use of wrong ingredient (except if this introduces an undeclared allergen)
Incorrect “Best before date” applied
Score 2: Medium severity
This type of hazard could cause serious harm to the consumer, for example short term illness or perhaps slight cuts or abrasions. Typical examples of this type of hazard might include:
Foreign objects which are unlikely to be ingested or to present a choking hazard
Residual detergent in process equipment
Enteric viruses such as Norovirus 
Pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus which rarely cause serious illness
Pesticide or heavy metal residues in food
Score 3: High severity
This type of hazard could cause actual significant illness such as food poisoning or actual bodily harm such as choking or internal bleeding. Typical examples might include:
Pathogenic bacteria or their toxins which cause serious illness or may kill such as E.coli o157 and other VTEC, Salmonella, Clostridium botulinum.
Protozoa such as Cryptospiridium
Sharp glass or metal fragments which might be ingested
Food allergens
3.   Provide a likelihood score for each hazard
This is an assessment of the likelihood that the hazard will actually occur. Careful judgement should be exercised here to ensure that an effective filter is put in place to ensure that you do not spend an inordinate amount of time taking measures to prevent an event that is unlikely to happen in the first place. When considering this score you should take into account:
The product description as set out in Preparatory Stage E and in particular any chemical or physical properties of your food which might encourage or inhibit microbial growth
Any published guidance on the likelihood of the hazard, such as food poisoning statistics or information produced by the Food Standards Agency
The history of such hazards associated with your food
You should score the likelihood of the hazard actually occurring on a scale of 1 to 3.
Score 1 indicates “Low” likelihood. Here it is unlikely, although still possible, that the event will occur. In other words, it is possible but not probable that the hazard will occur in practice. 
Score 2 indicates“Medium” likelihood. Here it is reasonably foreseeable that the hazard will occur. It could happen although there may not be any evidence of it having happened before.
Score 3 indicates “High” likelihood. It is very likely that the hazard will occur.
4.   Determine your significant score
Once you have entered values for the “Severity” and “Likelihood” for a given hazard at a process step, a “Significance” rating score (9 is the maximum score) will automatically be generated.
 
You should now identify a significance score above which you are going to consider the hazard to be significant and take it forward to the next stage. 
 
For example: 
If you specify that a score of 3 is significant all those hazards scoring 3 or above will be taken through to the next stage in MyHACCP (Principle 1.3), all those hazards scoring 2 and below will be controlled and managed through effective prerequisite programmes.
 
If you specify that a score of 4 is significant all those hazards scoring 4 or above will be taken through to the next stage in MyHACCP (Principle 1.3), all those hazards scoring 3 and below will be controlled and managed through effective prerequisite programmes."

2740,1,"[Cocoa butter types](https://feople.io/t/cocoa-butter-types/2740)

Commercially produced types of cocoa butter are defined as follows according to Codex Alimentarius:

- Pressed Cocoa Butter: Oil obtained by pressing from cocoa or cocoa liquor. In the United States, this oil is known as premium oil.

- Expeller Cocoa Butter: It is defined as the oil obtained by the expeller process. In this process, the cocoa bean is pressed without any treatment and without dehulling as a whole. The expelled cocoa butter thus obtained has a stronger aroma and a darker color than premium cocoa butter. The expeller cocoa butter is suitable for use after filtration by carbon.

- Cocoa Butter Obtained by Solvent Extraction: Cocoa butter obtained by solvent extraction from cocoa beans, cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor or cocoa cake, usually using hexane.

-Refined Cocoa Butter: This is the cocoa butter obtained as a result of refining the impurities, unwanted odors and flavors from the three types of cocoa butter.

**Chemical Structure of Cocoa Butter**

- Cocoa butter is a natural oil that can vary widely in composition. In this respect, soft cocoa butter is obtained from cocoa grown in Brazil, medium hardness is obtained from cocoa grown in Africa and hard cocoa butter is grown from Malaysia.

**Cocoa Butter Production Technologies**

- Cocoa butter; There are three different extraction methods: hydraulic pressure, solvent and expeller pressing. The quality of the obtained cocoa butter depends on the quality of the cocoa beans used rather than the applied extraction method. High quality oil is obtained from fully ripened, well-fermented and fully dried grains. Although quality oil can never be produced from poor quality grains, low quality oil can be obtained from quality grains due to unsuitable production conditions."

Throughout history, safe food supply is known to be one of the main occupations of people and especially the food sector. In this context, although food safety management systems such as HACCP and ISO 22000 are used, these systems provide food safety by taking into consideration natural contamination. However, it is not sufficient against deliberate contamination and adulteration. Since food safety management systems are dynamic systems, it is necessary to identify new emerging dangers and threats and to update methodologies against every situation and to develop new methodologies when necessary.

The impact of HACCP against accidental contamination has been proven, but the HACCP principles cannot be used effectively and successfully to detect or reduce intentional attacks. The only factor behind attacks that result in deliberate contamination is human. They may be from inside the food sector or from outside. Their main purpose may be to harm human health, the reputation of the producer or the economic gain of the producer. Each of these situations shows that the food sector needs to be protected from these attacks. Therefore, new guidelines and new food safety management systems have been published: Threat Assessment at Critical Control Points (TACCP) against food terrorism and Vulnerability Analysis and Critical Control Points (VACCP) for the protection of vulnerable foods.

Instead of using a HACCP plan to identify and control hazards when they occur, a HARPC plan aims to prevent hazards that occur initially. This includes hazards such as vulnerabilities and threats as described in the previous sections.

Food safety, food quality, food defense and food forgery are definitions that can be used to explain these three systems. There is definitely a food safety and health risk in HACCP and TACCP. In VACCP, there may not always be a food safety risk."

In addition to that, slightly increases the moisture, protein, and ash and decreases the fat content in meat. In the U.S and other countries, it was common practice for animal meat production.

**Proteolytic enzymes**  have injected into chicken shortly before it is slaughtered so that the pumping action of the heart circulates the tenderizer throughout the tissues.

As a result, when the chicken has slaughtered and the meat cuts are prepared, they have more tenderness.

By reducing the microbial load of the milk, heat treatment is applied in order to obtain a product with long shelf life and beneficial to the health of the consumer. There are many types of heat treatment. One of these, UHT, heat treatment at 135–150 ° C for 2-6 sec (Çakmakçı S. et al.).

UHT sterilization method is made directly and indirectly in two ways. In the direct method, either steam injection or steam infusion is performed and sterilization process is performed in 5 seconds at 140C. In indirect method, sterilization is done in 2 seconds at 140C without any contact with plate or tube heat exchangers. The taste and odor produced in the sterilization by direct method gives the closest taste and smell to pasteurized milk (Çağlar A., ​​and Çağlar M.Y.)

**Defects in UHT milk:**

- High temperature lactose decomposes causing undesirable odor, taste and color (it is not resistant to above 100 ° C).

- Fat globules membrane breaks down and denaturing proteins surrounding membrane,

- Loss of some water-soluble vitamins,

- Decrease in nutritional value of milk by causing damage to high temperature sensitive amino acids,

- Decrease in solubility of serum proteins and prolonged coagulation with casein at isoelectric point,

- SH groups are exposed to cause cooked taste,

- Reduces solubility of calcium and phosphate in water phase,

- Maillard reaction. Maillard reaction causes the loss of lysine and arginine, one of the basic amino acids, the nutritional value of milk decreases and also creates an undesired cooked taste in the taste and smell,

- When packaging is not done well, oxygen enters from the packaging, UHT milk contains more than soluble oxygen, causing vitamin losses,

- Leaving too much of the air gap during milk filling causes microbial contamination and causes many losses such as vitamin losses,

- The color browning due to storage for a long time,

- In direct UHT sterilization, if the milk is first homogenized and then sterilized, it will cause gelation in the milk.

- Low homogenization pressure causes gelling,

- Lipase and protease enzymes remain after sterilization when using raw milk with psychrotroph bacteria number more than 106 cfu / ml. The protease enzyme causes gelation in milk,

- In UHT milk stored at high temperature, SH groups decrease within two weeks and stale occurs. Accelerating unwanted reactions such as high temperature caramelization, gelling and browning,

- In the absence of excess air in the milk after sterilization, fat oxidation occurs and consequently the formation of ransid taste.

Causes of these defects and ways of prevention:

-The temperature process should be completed in a shorter time instead of keeping it at very high temperature for a long time,

- Storage should be done at low temperature. For example, in UHT milk stored in 5-6C, SH groups decrease in longer time so that byte time is prolonged,

- Be very careful about packaging. The soluble oxygen content of the milk should not be too high. For this; the joints of the packaging should be glued well, the packaging with aluminum foil layer should be used, and the packaging material should be airtight.

-The head space should not be left too much while filling the boxes,

- Direct sterilization systems can be used instead of indirect since the taste and aroma in the direct system is closer to the pasteurized milk.

- In order to prevent oil globules from aggregating after pecting, the milk should be sterilized first and then homogenized in direct sterilization.

- Homogenization can be done twice to prevent oil separation (Chenk and Gelda, 1975),

- Raw milk should not be stored at 5 ° C for more than 3 days to prevent gelation, and UHT milk should be stored at low temperature,

- Substances such as potassium iodate, L-cystine and immobilized sulfhydryl oxidase may be added to reduce the cooked taste,

- In order to prevent brown color in the milk, direct sterilization should be performed instead of indirect sterilization. Generally, the color of the milk sterilized by direct method is whiter than the indirect sterilized milk.

- Sedimentation rate is significantly reduced by adding substances such as citrate, bicarbate and hydrogen phosphate to prevent sedimentation. The amount of sedimentation in direct sterilization is higher than the index sterilization.

- After sterilization, the air in the milk should be removed so that no oil oxidation occurs and a rasid taste occurs.

- Homogenization should be done at high pressure to prevent the formation of the seed, storage time should not be long, storage temperature should be low, raw milk quality should be high, the number of psychrotroph bacteria should not be more than 106 cfu / ml, psychrorof bacteria are transmitted to raw milk after milking because they do not exist in natural flora. In order to produce high quality and perfect UHT milk, first of all milking equipment sanitation should be done very well, hygiene rules should be followed in milk transportation and storage, and milk producers should be informed for all of them.

**RESULT**

We have seen that some defects and negativity may be encountered in UHT milk sterilization when the application conditions are not observed. However, the milk produced by the direct UHT sterilization method has the same taste-odor and nutritional value as the pasteurized milk and has a shelf life of 4-6 months. This is the more preferred milk in terms of both consumer health and producer.

12078,1,"Hello. Hope you are doing well. This is a good initiative that you have started. Good luck to you. Its just that I came across the Nutrient Finder, I tried to randomly search for a food product. That's when I noticed that values and the units vary. 

For example : When I search for Rice,

Energy: 139,000 kcals
Proteins: 8980 grams

Its just an suggestion that you change the units maybe. Also, it would be great if you could add a search based on quantity for calculation.  For ex - 100g, 200g or 1 kg, etc.

That would very helpful for others as well.

Thanks & Regards,

1229,1,"Extending the shelf life of foods, improving the sensory properties of foods, preserving the food, quality characteristics, preserving the nutritive value by assisting in food preparation.

Classification of Food Additives

1.Preservatives

a. Antimicrobials: Nitrites and nitrates (E250, E251) are the most widely discussed of these substances used to protect nutrients in bacteria, mold, yeast spoilage, prolong shelf life, and preserve natural color and aroma.

b. Antioxidants Undesirable in food, odor, aroma, taste changes, enzymatic darkening or discoloration, oxidation (oxidative acidity) prevention / retardation, such as benefits, especially in oils and fatty foods are used, extend shelf life (ascorbic acid, etc.). Oxidative reactions in food occur as a result of the destruction of lipids, colorants, essential amino acids and vitamins.

2.Developing the structure and preparation and cooking properties

a. pH regulators

The acidity regulators are used to adjust the pH of the food. They may also exhibit bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effects on the diet by lowering the pH. Increased acidity increases the heat sensitivity of many pathogenic and nutrient microorganisms. Cooking and other heat treatment extends the shelf life of nutrients by destroying bacteria.

b. Anti-caking

Anti-caking agents are used to maintain the flowability of powdered mixtures such as salt, powdered sugar, spices, instant soups, milk powder, and to prevent caking and aggregation (aluminum silicate, tricalcium phosphate).

c. Emulsifiers (lecithin, mono and diglycerides)

They are used for mixing water and oil in food and providing homogeneous distribution by reducing surface tension (lecithin, sorbitan monostearate, etc.).

d.Stabilizers, thickeners, artificial sweeteners

Stabilizers; They are used to prevent re-separation of oil and water. Gelling agent; Gives food texture with gel formation (goat horn gum, pectin, etc.). Artificial sweeteners; It is used to make the aroma and taste more attractive and to give the sweet taste (without calories) (aspartame, acesulfame K, sorbitol, saccharin).

Others Color stabilizing agent; stabilizes the color of the food, ensures its persistence Baking agent increases the volume of the dough by releasing gas. Flour Processing Agent; improves the cooking quality or color of the flour.

3.Aroma and Color developers

a. Aroma substances

The most commonly used flavoring agent is monosodium glutamate (MSG). The taste created by MSG, called umami, can cause Chinese restaurant syndrome. MSG uptake may cause chest pain, facial burning, redness, paresthesia, sweating, dizziness, headache, palpitations, nausea and vomiting. Children may experience tremor and chills, irritability, scream and delirium. The mechanism of this picture is unknown. 15-20% of the general population appears to be sensitive to small doses of MSG, but in some individuals it may occur with large doses. Symptoms begin within one hour of food intake, but may be delayed from the onset to fourteen hours. Flavor enhancers are used to increase the flavor and / or odor present in the food, to make the aroma more attractive, to preserve and improve the original aroma.

b. Colorants

 They participate in order to regain the natural color lost during processing and storage, to strengthen the weak color, to give color to the colorless food that is actually colorless, and to gain consumer appreciation by hiding low quality. These substances are used in many products such as soft drinks, candies, ice creams, gels, bakery products, artificial powder drinks, gums, wafer biscuits and creams.

4.Nutritional preservatives (Nutrients)

a. Substitutes of nutrients lost during processing (B1, B2, niacin)

b. Added to the elements that may be missing in the diet (vitamins A, D)."

102,1,"Bioactive peptides are formed by amino acids joined by peptide bonds and defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions, and may influence health. Some bioactive peptides exist free in its natural source. However,  the vast majority of known bioactive peptides are inactive within the structure of the parent proteins and are released by enzymic hydrolysis or fermentation. Bioactive peptides play a significant role in human health by affecting the digestive, endocrine, cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems.  *In vitro*  and  *in vivo*  studies showed that bioactive peptides exhibited antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antihypertensive, opioid, immunomodulator, cholesterol lowering, mineral binding and antioxidant roperties. In this review, identification, sources, bioactive properties and health effects of bioactive peptides are addressed.

1134,1,"Food preservation methods have recently become one of the most frequently discussed issues. One of these preservation methods is microbiological inactivation. Various heat treatment techniques such as pasteurization, sterilization, freezing, drying and thickening are used to ensure the microbiological safety of food. However, these techniques cause loss of food in terms of taste, smell, texture, aroma and vitamins. Cold sterilization methods have been developed in which the freshness and naturalness of the food can be preserved without disturbing the quality of the food. Cold plasma technique, which is one of these methods, is more advantageous than other cold sterilization methods. This is because it minimizes the mentioned losses and ensures less energy consumption.

Plasma technology is a new alternative surface sterilization and disinfection process since it can inactivate both vegetative cells and bacterial spores in a short time at ambient temperature. A good conductor (conducts electricity and heat well), interacts with electric and magnetic fields, has a high rate of chemical reactions, high temperature and energy density. This technology was first discovered by Irving Langmuir in 1928. Plasma is formed by applying energy to a gas to rearrange the electrical structure of atoms and molecules and to produce excited species and ions.

The mechanism of action of plasma technology: Direct degradation of genetic materials of microorganisms by UV rays. As a result of the ‘etching’ effect, the microorganism is eroded at the atomic level. It is used only in modifications of heat-resistant inorganic materials (metals, metal oxides, etc.) since it is increased to 1000K in hot plasma, which is divided into hot and cold plasma types. Cold plasma is used for sterilization and preservation of foods. The cold plasma temperature is between 300–400K. The ion temperature is close to room temperature. For this reason, it is called cold plasma.

A cereal is any edible components of the grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis) of cultivated grass, composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops such as buckwheatt (Polygonaceae).For the assurance of future food security,there raise a need to come up with appropriate means that is both cereal grain friendly and farmers friendly.Many scientists have tried to identify some methods to reduce pest infestation but majority have not concentrated to implement the best alternatives to their side effects. The main objective of my research is to come up with biological methods of cereal preservation that targets both the farmers concerning their health, grain’s yield and future market as well as students and researchers in their study and research work. This study will involve first pre-study to small scale farming regions and will extend to large scale farming regions. The data will be collected through administering questionnaires to the farmers and collect their views concerning the modern and traditionalpreservation techniques.The data collected will be analyzed by the use of SPSS tool and the results be noted."

2100,1,"# Food Additive

Substances which are of little or no nutritive value, but are used in the processing or storage
of foods or animal feed, especially in the developed countries; includes antioxidants; food
preservatives; food coloring agents; flavoring agents; anti-infective agents; vehicles;
excipients and other similarly used substances. Many of the same substances are
pharmaceutics aids when added to pharmaceuticals rather than to foods. Food additives are
substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some
additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling with
vinegar, salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as in some wines.
With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the 20th century, many more
additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. It is sometimes wrongly
thought that food additives are a recent development, but there has certainly been an
increase in public interest in the topic. Not all of this has been well-informed, and there are
signs that commercial interests have been influenced by consumer pressure, as well as food
producers manipulating the situation by marketing techniques. Various labeling
regulations have been put into effect to ensure that contents of processed foods are known
to consumers, and to ensure that food is fresh-important in unprocessed foods and
probably important even if preservatives are used. In addition, we also need to add some
preservatives in order to prevent the food from spoiling. Direct additives are intentionally
added to foods for a particular purpose. Indirect additives are added to the food during
its processing, packaging and storage. Food Preservatives are the additives that are used
to inhibit the growth of bacteria, molds and yeasts in the food. Some of the additives are
manufactured from the natural sources such as corn, beet and soybean, while some are
artificial, man-made additives. Most people tend to eat the ready-made food available in
the market, rather than preparing it at home. Such foods contain some kind of additives
and preservatives, so that their quality and flavor is maintained and they are not spoiled
by bacteria and yeasts. More than 3000 additives and preservatives are available in the
market, which are used as antioxidants and anti-microbial agents. Salt and sugar the most
commonly used additives. Some of the commonly used food additives and preservatives
are aluminum silicate, amino acid compounds, ammonium carbonates, sodium nitrate,
propyl gallate, butylated hydrozyttoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA),
monosodium glutamate, white sugar, potassium bromate, potassium sorbate, sodium
benzoate, etc. Some artificial colors are also added to the foods to give them an appealing look.
These coloring substances are erythrosine (red), cantaxanthin (orange), amaranth
(Azoic red), tartrazine (Azoic yellow) and annatto bixine (yellow orange). When the food
is to be stored for a prolonged period, use of additives and preservatives is essential in
order to maintain its quality and flavor. The excess water in the foods can cause the
growth of bacteria, fungi and yeasts. Use of additives and preservatives prevents spoiling
of the foods due to the growth of bacteria and fungi. Additives and preservatives
maintain the quality and consistency of the foods. They also maintain palatability and
wholesomeness of the food, improve or maintain its nutritional value, control appropriate
pH, provide leavening and color, and enhance its flavor. There are even foods products
that are made entirely from chemicals. Coffee creamers, sugar substitutes, and candies
consist almost completely of artificial ingredients. Such manipulation of our food can
have a profound effect on our body’s unique biochemical balance. When we need to store
any food for a longer time, it should be properly processed. During this processing, some
substances and chemicals, known as additives, are added to the food. Additives
consistently maintain the high quality of foods."

Postharvest handling of the potato is an important factor not only in preventing postharvest losses but also in maintaining its safety and nutritional quality. Exposure of the potato to unfavorable conditions such as light, extreme temperatures, and bruising can result in accumulation of glycoalkaloids, which are toxic substances. This study was a cross-sectional survey which aimed to investigate the postharvest handling practices of potatoes and perception of potato safety among open air market traders in Nairobi County, Kenya. Information was collected from 100 potato traders using a semistructured questionnaire that assessed postharvest handling practices such as potato transportation, exposure to sunlight, and storage.

Results indicated that most of the potatoes (88%) took one day to be transported to the market, with the storage period at the market ranging from 2 to 3 days for most traders (42%). Forty-seven percent (47%) of the vehicles and hand-pulled carts used to transport potatoes had open backs, while 53% had closed backs. Over half (69%) of the potatoes in the markets were directly exposed to sunlight, with 75% of the traders leaving their potatoes in the open covered with a polythene bag after the day’s activities. Greening, sprouting, or bruised potatoes were mostly sold as seed, sold to restaurants and French fries vendors, or sold to consumers at a lower price. 

More than half of the traders did not think that consumption of greened potatoes is harmful to health. The results clearly show that there is poor handling of the potatoes by the traders which increases the risk of consumer exposure to glycoalkaloids. There is, therefore, a need to create awareness among traders on appropriate postharvest handling of potatoes to protect consumer health and reduce economic losses as well.

Cheese is the most diverse dairy product in the world. It is likely that Asian nomads were the first to discover cheese. The nomads, who received almost all of their livelihoods from the animals they fed, used the animal's tripe or untanned leather bags to store food. Milk turns into cheese thanks to the enzyme of renin in the tripe. In the excavations carried out by archaeologists, perforated containers were found for cheese making in the 4,000 and 6,000 BC, and it is thought that the curd was used to drain the water. Some preservation ways have been found for the use of cheese, which is so old in history, for a long time. One of these ways of protection has been to put it in animal hide.

Sheep cheese made of animal hide is the name given to various regions of Turkey to the specific cheese. Natural contaminant microorganisms, especially molds, develop during ripening and contribute to the ripening process. The maturation process is provided by holding in potholes, caves, cellars or cold storage rooms as it has become widespread in recent years. Tulum cheese is traditionally matured in overalls made from goat or sheepskin.

Tulum cheese varies according to the region where it is produced. Tulum cheese produced in Konya, Bingöl, Erzincan, Elazığ, Tunceli and Erzurum regions is called Erzincan tulumu or Şavak cheese. Tulum cheese made in Çankırı and Çorum regions is known as pike tulumu. There is also a type of pickled tulum cheese made in the Aegean Region and is known as Izmir Tulum cheese. There is another type belonging to Bergama. In addition, tulum cheese is produced in the Koçkar village plateau in the Kemah district of Erzincan.

Tulum cheese is usually produced by traditional methods in small family businesses and primitive dairies. Today, tulum cheese, which has gained the admiration of almost every segment, has started to be produced in larger and modern enterprises and in large quantities over time.

14481,1,"Hello,

I want to develop a vegan ice-cream. 
In my country, there are very few vegan ice cream manufactures, and they all use coconut-cream as their base ingredient, which leaves a coconut off-flavor that a lot of customers don't like. Therefore, my main concern is finding a different liquid base and a proper protein source other than coconut milk / coconut milk solids. 

As for the moment, I am using:

-Liquid base: oat milk (for its natural flavor and aeration propeties)
-Sugars: sucrose, dextrose, glucose 40DE, trehalose
-Other solids: inulin, maltodextrin (malto for bulking solids and inulin for more creaminess)
-Emulsifiers: mono-diglycerides and polysorbate80 at 80:20 ratio
-Stabilizers: locust bean-gun, guar gum, kappa carrageenan, in a ratio of 4:2:1

I am quite satisfied with the flavor and the texture, but as I don't use any protein source, there is a poor over-run and it freezes too hard (regardless to the sugar profile i choose). On top of that, oat milk could be pricey, and I suspect that a proper protein would allow me to use water as my base. 

I have read Ice Cream 7th edition by Goff and some articles about the subject, but as I am not a food scientist myself, I would be thankful if anyone could give me an advice of how to improve my recipe.

Table sugars were pyrolyzed at different temperatures (300, 400, and 500°C) in a fixed-bed reactor. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on yields of liquid, solid, and gaseous products was investigated. As expected the yield of liquid products gradually increased and the yield of solid products gradually decreased when the pyrolysis temperature was raised.

The yield of liquid products was greatest (52 wt%) at 500°C. The composition of bio-oils extracted with diethyl ether was identified by means of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 

The following compounds were observed in bio-oils produced from the pyrolysis of table sugar at 500°C: 1,4:3,6-dianhydro- *α* -d-glucopyranose, 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural, 5-acetoxymethyl-2-furaldehyde, and cyclotetradecane liquid product. The relative concentration of 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural was the highest in bio-oils obtained from pyrolysis of table sugars at 500°C.

441,1,"**Abstract**

Limited information exists on the status of hygiene and probable sources of microbial contamination in Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) puree processing. The current study is aimed at determining the level of compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), hygiene, and microbial quality in OFSP puree processing plant in Kenya. 

Intensive observation and interviews using a structured GMPs checklist, environmental sampling, and microbial analysis by standard microbiological methods were used in data collection. The results indicated low level of compliance to GMPs with an overall compliance score of 58%. 

Microbial counts on food equipment surfaces, installations, and personnel hands and in packaged OFSP puree were above the recommended microbial safety and quality legal limits. Steaming significantly () reduced microbial load in OFSP cooked roots but the counts significantly () increased in the puree due to postprocessing contamination.

Total counts, yeasts and molds, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and  *E. coli*  and  *S. aureus*  counts in OFSP puree were 8.0, 4.0, 6.6, 5.8, 4.8, and 5.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively. In conclusion, equipment surfaces, personnel hands, and processing water were major sources of contamination in OFSP puree processing and handling. Plant hygiene inspection, environmental monitoring, and food safety trainings are recommended to improve hygiene, microbial quality, and safety of OFSP puree.

8179,1,"1.	INTRODUCTION
Demand of nutrition based functional food biscuit increasing rapidly due to the increasing awareness about the health, avoiding unhealthy backing foods and sufficient amount of nutraceuticals activities. The consumer trend has widened, many have begun to look at food not only for its basic nutrition but also for the allied health.
Benefits black seed termed as herbal .They have most health benefits and nutrition. Fixed oil and essential oil are obtained from black seed. That fixed oil is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and to some extent thymoquinone, whilst essential oil is abundant in bioactive molecules like thymoquinone, p-cymene, carvacrol, α-thujene and thymol (Marcu Monica, 2019).
It has many biological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and wound healing activities (Mukhtar Hamid, 2019).
Biscuits, being higher in fat contents, would be a better carrier for provision of desirable quantities of antioxidants and tocopherols to the vulnerable segments by adding black cumin fixed and essential oil in various proportions (Tauseef Sultan, 2009). 
Keeping in view the above, the present research proposal was designed to Development black seed oil (fixed & essential) functional food biscuit and it will be a best value added product in food in market.
The purpose of the research is we can develop adding up of black cumin fixed and essential oils in Cereal-based food products like biscuits and we can eat this daily an alternative for high calories biscuits. Because of these, we can cure our health issues and nutritional problems as soon as possible."

I'm working on developing a food product based on whole, large Lion's Mane mushroom fruit bodies. These will be prepared in some form (cooked and pressed into approx 1"" thick flat shape) and flavored (liquid marinade or dry spice rub), then packaged (likely vacuum sealed), frozen, and sold to market.

**Goal:**
* Create a more meat like texture with less of the sponge and pop mouth feel that's typically associated with mushrooms, especially in the thickest sections of the mushroom.
* Maintain large size and thickness

**Limited Success:**
So far I've had only limited success employing dehydration (warm air 105-120F) at various stages of the process, but non have created exactly what I'm looking for.  The unfortunate result of dehydration is that while it does improve texture, it also shrinks the overall size of the product.

**Yet to test:**
* Natural chemical treament (i.e. baking soda, gums, etc)
* Freeze drying
* Fermentation

**Help Needed:**
* Does anyone have a suggestion how to achieve a more meat-like texture from a whole Lion's Mane fruit body that will mostly maintain the overall shape and size?

Much appreciated!!"

As you know, the use of Glucose and Fuructose inverted sugars, known as corn syrup, is common in the world. The main factors in the use of these sugars are that they prolong the shelf life and provide physical advantages to the products they are used in. The fact that there is a lot of interest in these types of sugar has brought corn production to crazy levels in the world.
There is a product in Turkey that has just been completed and whose R&D studies have been terminated. An enzymatic reaction that causes the inversion of sucrose into Glucose and Fructose. It is a sugar that you can use in all food businesses that have to use glucose, including the jam, marmalade and fruit juice sector.
There are many countries and companies that perform enzyme inversion, but with the method they use, this process is carried out under vacuum at high temperatures for as long as 70 hours.
With this new method, the inversion is completely finished in 6 hours at 75 degrees Celsius and the result is obtained. Moreover, since the process is not applied at high temperature, Caramelization does not occur. The HMF value is almost 0 (zero).
For more detailed information, please contact +90 542 775 31 80 Watsapp line. This product is currently licensed in Turkey and has started to be used in the sweet and jam sector.
The use of this product will now eliminate the use of GMO corn syrups in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in syrup production. Every R&D work done in the food industry adds value to the system."

![Manuka Honey|690x459, 75%](upload://uCUDEhksJpptuY1DtiBY0x8T9r.jpeg) 

Honey has been used as a food and medical product since the earliest times. 

It has been used in many cultures for its medicinal properties, as a remedy for burns, cataracts, ulcers and wound healing, because it exerts a soothing effect when initially applied to open wounds. 

Depending on its origin, honey can be classified in different categories among which, monofloral honey seems to be the most promising and interesting as a natural remedy. 

Manuka honey, a monofloral honey derived from the manuka tree
(Leptospermum scoparium), has greatly attracted the attention of researchers for its biological properties, especially its antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities.

Our manuscript reviews the chemical composition and the variety of beneficial nutritional and health effects of manuka honey. 

Firstly, the chemical composition of manuka honey is described, with special attention given to its polyphenolic composition and other bioactive compounds, such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal. 

***Then, the effect of manuka honey in wound treatment is described, as well as its antioxidant activity and other important biological effects.***

Chips are prepared by slicing potatoes and frying the chips in vessel contained oil at controlled temperature using the furnace. The crisp of chips depends on a number of factors including the quality of oil, the temperature of the oil, frying time, quality of potato and moisture contained in the chips. This review concludes with a case study of a manufacturing unit producing potato chips.

**Abstract of Article**

This work was aimed at investigating the effect of storage temperature on the physicochemical, nutritional, and microbial quality of soursop juice. Physicochemical quality was determined by measuring changes in pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids and colour (L*a*b* values). Ascorbic acid levels, total phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity were analysed to determine the effect of storage temperature on nutritional quality. 

The changes in aerobic mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria,  *Enterobacteriaceae* , as well as yeast and moulds were enumerated to determine the effect of storage temperature on microbial quality. Soursop juice was pasteurised at 85°C for 5 min and stored at varying temperatures of 4, 10 and 25°C. Storage was carried out for 12 weeks at both 4 and 10°C, while at 25°C the juice was stored for 3.5 weeks when visible signs of spoilage was detected. Storing soursop juice at 4ºC did not affect quality, however, at 25°C, decreases in pH and total soluble solids with an increase in titratable acidity was observed. In addition, a faster rate of ascorbic acid degradation was observed at 25°C. 

The main group of microorganisms that were responsible for the spoilage of soursop juice stored at 25°C were lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and moulds. The results of this work show that pasteurised soursop juice can be stored at refrigeration temperatures without changes in quality.

4368,1,"Flour is a key ingredient to any type of baked product. It contains the main component for dough texture and structure development: Gluten.

Gluten makes up 85-90% of the protein content found in wheat grains. 

It is a water-insoluble network that makes the dough elastic and stretchy due to a series of hydrophobic bonding and disulfide bonding involving amino acids during mixing and kneading.

The higher the content of protein present in your flour, the more gluten it can develop.

So, for your next baking session, consider checking the protein content of the flour you are about to use. Typical yeast bread require at least 12% proteins and higher, while cakes and cookies only require 12% below.

2055,1,"## Information on the risks of acrylamide and how you can reduce the chances of being harmed by it.

<iframe width=""760"" height=""415"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWEXJkxBO4w"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Acrylamide is a chemical substance formed when starchy foods, such as potatoes and bread, are cooked at high temperatures (above 120°C). It can be formed when foods are:

* baked
* fried
* grilled
* toasted
* roasted

Acrylamide is not deliberately added to foods – it is a natural by-product of the cooking process and has always been present in our food.

It is found in a wide range of foods including:

* roasted potatoes and root vegetables
* chips
* crisps
* toast
* cakes
* biscuits
* cereals
* coffee

## Potential health effects of acrylamide

Laboratory tests show that acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals. Scientists agree that acrylamide in food has the potential to cause cancer in humans as well. We recommend that the amount of acrylamide we all consume is reduced, as a precaution.

## What the food industry is doing to reduce acrylamide

The food industry has undertaken a lot of work to identify and implement measures to reduce acrylamide levels in food. This includes developing guidance on ways to limit acrylamide formation in a variety of foods and processes. New legislation will require food business operators to put in place simple, practical steps to manage acrylamide within their food safety management systems.

## How to reduce acrylamide at home

To reduce your consumption of acrylamide when preparing food at home, we advise you should:

* aim for a golden yellow colour or lighter when frying, baking, toasting or roasting starchy foods
* follow the cooking instructions on the pack when cooking packaged foods like chips and roast potatoes
* eat a healthy, balanced diet to help reduce your risk of cancer

You also need to make sure that you don’t store raw potatoes in the fridge if you intend to cook them at high temperatures, such as by roasting or frying. This is because keeping raw potatoes in the fridge can lead to the formation of more free sugars in the potatoes. This process is sometimes called ‘cold sweetening’.

Cold sweetening can increase overall acrylamide levels, especially if the potatoes are then fried, roasted or baked. Raw potatoes should be stored in a dark, cool place at temperatures above 6°C.

Campylobacter is the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. The majority of people who get ill from campylobacter recover fully and quickly but it can cause long-term and severe health problems in some. Children under five and older people are most at risk because they may have weaker immune systems.

You can’t see campylobacter, smell it or even taste it on food. But if it affects you, you won’t forget it.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYlp1_7XIw4"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## How campylobacter is spread

About four in five cases of campylobacter food poisoning in the UK come from contaminated poultry, especially chicken.

One of the main ways to get and spread campylobacter poisoning is through cross-contamination from raw chicken. For example, washing raw chicken can spread campylobacter by splashing it onto hands, work surfaces, clothing and cooking equipment.

Campylobacter is also found in red meat, unpasteurised milk and untreated water. Although it does not normally grow in food, it spreads easily. Campylobacter has a low infective dose, which means that coming into contact with a few bacteria can cause illness. This is especially important if you are young or have an underlying illness.

## Avoiding campylobacter poisoning at home

You can help keep your family safe from campylobacter by chilling your food, cooking chicken correctly, avoiding cross-contamination and ensuring good personal hygiene.

### Chilling your food

To chill your food, always store your food in the fridge, which should be at 5° or below.

### Cooking chicken correctly

It is important to cook chicken correctly by following the guidance on time and temperature and checking:

* the meat is steaming hot all the way through
* none of the meat is pink when you cut into the thickest part
* any juices run clear

### Avoiding cross-contamination

You can avoid cross-contamination by never washing chicken or letting raw chicken come into contact with ready-to-eat foods.

Good personal hygiene will help ensure that any bacteria you have come into contact with aren’t passed to your friends and family in their food.

Dynamic micro-CT in the TESCAN UniTOM XL is used to visualize high-temperature applications at high temporal resolutions. We image baking of cookies and biscuits, in real-time and in 4D, illustrating how bubbles form inside the dough and at which points in the baking process the dough shrinks or expands. Using convective heating – powered through our in-situ integration kit - and heat resistant crucibles, we can perform these experiments inside the micro-CT scanner.  

Another high-temperature application shows the melting process of sugar, at no less than 186 degrees Celsius. The transition from solid sugar grains to a liquid caramel is observed, and the temporal resolution is even high enough to follow air bubbles inside the caramel mass.

Finally, mechanical tests of cookies are used to study and understand their strength. How the baked cookies behave under a load is important for the mouth feeling of the consumer, and this has a direct influence on how the finished product is appreciated."

Nowadays, one of the main objectives of the fruit and vegetable industry is to develop
innovative novel products with high quality, safety, and optimal nutritional characteristics in order to respond with efficiency to the increasing consumer expectations. Various emerging, unconventional technologies (e.g., pulsed electric field, pulsed light, ultrasound, high pressure, and microwave drying) enable the processing of fruits and vegetables, increasing their stability while preserving their thermolabile nutrients, flavour, texture, and overall quality. Some of these technologies can also be used for waste and by-product valorisation. 


The application of fast noninvasive methods for process control is of great importance for the fruit and vegetable industry. The following Special Issue “Safety, Quality, and Processing of Fruits and Vegetables” consists of 11 papers, which provide a high-value contribution to the existing knowledge on safety aspects, quality evaluation, and emerging processing technologies for fruits and vegetables.

2267,1,"Abstract

Olive oils contain numerous substances that have a beneficial role in human health. Phenols are natural compounds that are present in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), and they are produced at the malaxation step of the olive oil production. The four most abundant phenols in EVOO are oleocanthal, oleacein, ligstroside aglycon, and oleuropein aglycon. 


These phenols exhibit significant biological effects in many diseases, participating in various cellular and biochemical processes. Oleocanthal can protect and prevent against the Alzheimer disease, demonstrates acute antiplatelet effects, which has a vital role against cancer, and can act like ibuprofen. Oleacein has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and helps against atherosclerosis. 

Moreover, it acts as an antiaging factor and as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Ligstroside aglycon implicates to mechanisms against breast cancer, while oleuropein aglycon shows activities against the Alzheimer disease and breast cancer.

1929,1,"## Abstract

In extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extraction process, the occurrence of yeasts that could affect the quality of olive oil was demonstrated. Therefore, in this work, at first, the yeasts occurring during different extractive processes carried out in a Tuscany oil mill, at the beginning, in the middle, and the end of the harvesting in the same crop season, were quantified. Then, possible effects on quality of EVOO caused by the predominant yeast species, possessing specific enzymatic activities, were evaluated. Yeast concentrations were higher in extraction processes at the end of the harvesting.

Twelve yeast species showing different isolation frequencies during olive oil extractive process and according to the harvesting date were identified by molecular methods. The yeast species dominating olive oil samples from decanter displayed enzymatic activities, potentially affecting EVOO quality according to zymogram analysis. 

HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis of the volatile compounds in commercial EVOO, inoculated with three yeast species (Nakazawaea molendini-olei, Nakazawaea wickerhamii, Yamadazyma terventina), pointed out significant differences depending on the strain inoculated. In conclusion, during the olive oil extractive processes, some yeast species colonize the extraction plant and may influence the chemical and sensory characteristics of EVOO depending on the cell concentrations and their enzymatic capabilities

Postharvest losses are rampant due to lack of proper storage conditions and handling of the fresh food products. 

The perishable nature of fruits and vegetables makes their shelf life limited due to some extrinsic factors such as some environmental conditions and preservation conditions as well as some intrinsic factors such as respiration rate, ethylene production and transpiration. Among the other postharvest technologies available, [edible coating](https://feople.io/t/edible-coating/13545)s seems to be one novel method which has been verified to have a positive and safe approach to extending the shelf
life of products. 

This type of packaging is made from various natural resources like polysaccharide, protein and lipid materials. Edible packaging materials can be divided into two main groups including edible coatings and edible films. It has so many benefits such as serving as a moisture barrier, oxygen scavenger, ethylene scavenger, antimicrobial properties among others. 

Different methods of application of the edible coating on the food materials include; dipping, spraying, brushing, layer by layer among others. There have been several verifications of the positive impact of edible coatings/films on pome fruits, Citrus fruits, Stone fruits, tropical and exotic fruits, berries, melon, tomatoes and others.

3908,1,"Antimicrobial Activity and Mechanism of Action of the Amaranthus tricolor Crude Extract against Staphylococcus aureus and Potential Application in Cooked Meat

Amaranthus tricolor has been reported to contain some antimicrobial compounds, such as alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenoids. However, its effect on Staphylococcus aureus has been less well researched.

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of the Amaranthus tricolor crude extract (ATCE) against S. aureus and potential application in cooked meat. The antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was assessed by disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations, and growth curve.

The changes of bacterial membrane potential, intracellular pH (pHin), content of bacterial protein and DNA, and cell morphology were measured to indicate its antimicrobial mechanism of action. The effects of different concentrations of ATCE on bacterial counts, pH, and color of lean cooked pork during 6 d storage were assessed. The results showed that the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) and MIC of ATCE against S. aureus were 12.63 ± 0.34 to 12.94 ± 0.43 mm and 80 mg/mL, respectively.

The mechanism of action of ATCE against S. aureus was associated with cell membrane depolarization, reduction of pHin, decrease of bacterial protein content, cleavage of cell DNA, and leakage of cytoplasm. Besides, ATCE resulted in a reduction of 1.02 log CFU/g from 3 log CFU/g in S. aureus-inoculated lean cooked pork. The pH values of lean cooked pork treated with ATCE did not show significant changes as the storage time increased, but there was a slight and significant decrease seen with the application of 1 and 2 MIC of ATCE. After treating with ATCE, the color of lean cooked pork showed less lightness (L*), more redness (a∗), similar yellowness (b*), stronger chroma (C*), and weaker hue angle (h*) during 6 days of storage.

Therefore, these findings indicate that ATCE has antimicrobial activities against S. aureus and possesses latent energy to become a natural preservative to maintain the quality of lean cooked pork.

Food brewing technology is an important technology in the modern worldwide food industry, which uses the specific traits of microorganisms to produce food by traditional or modern engineering techniques. The products produced by food brewing technology have spread all over the world. Among them, alcoholic products (Chinese Baijiu, fruit wine, rice wine, beer, whisky, etc.), as important fermented food, have been loved by consumers all over the world. This Special Issue includes a total of eleven articles, and nine of them involve research on brewing technology of alcoholic products and brewing microorganisms. This phenomenon indicates that the alcoholic products industry occupies an important position in the field of food fermentation. Therefore, in response to the research content of these nine articles, this editorial mainly explores the research hotspots in the field of alcohol brewing.

Organic acid is one of the main flavor substances in fruit wine. An appropriate amount of organic acids can give fruit wine a smooth taste and have certain antibacterial effects, but the high organic acid content gives people an unpleasant experience, which seriously affects the sensory quality of fruit wine. At present, the high content of organic acids in fruit wine has become one of the important obstacles restricting the further development of the fruit wine brewing industry. The usual method to alleviate excessive acidity is deacidification by chemical or physical processing. 

Unfortunately, the methods of chemical or physical are not effective in all cases and may reduce the stability of the wine. However, a biological deacidification method, such as malolactic fermentation (MLF), can significantly reduce the concentration of malic acid and total acidity in wines, without negatively impacting the flavor quality. Yang et al. (2022) found that an Oenococcus oeni GF-2 strain had good MLF performance and high glucosidase activity. 



MLF significantly decreased the concentration of organic acids by 29.7% and promoted the accumulation of aromatic esters, higher alcohols, and terpenoids. MLF wine achieved the highest sensory scores for aroma, taste, and overall acceptability [1]. This study indicated that MLF with O. oeni GF-2 had great potential to markedly improve the aroma and taste of commercial pear–kiwifruit wine. Meantime, the biological deacidification method may gradually replace chemical or physical deacidification methods in the future, becoming the main method to reduce the organic acid content in fruit wine.

Generally, foods are thermally processed to destroy the vegetative microorganisms for food preservation. However, only thermal treatment triggers many unwanted biochemical reactions, which leads to undesirable sensorial and nutritional effects. Therefore, a number of nontraditional preservation techniques are being developed to satisfy consumer demand with regard to nutritional and sensory aspects of foods. Ensuring food safety and at the same time meeting such demands for retention of nutrition and quality attributes has resulted in increased interest in emerging preservation techniques. 

These emerging food preservation technologies can extend the shelf life of unprocessed or processed foods by inactivating the enzymes, reducing the food spoiling microbial growth rate or viability without altering the food quality attributes including flavor, odor, color, texture, and nutritional value. On the emerging technology, sphere promising results have been attained by the radiation processes. Ionizing radiation has been widely used in industrial processes, especially in the sterilization of medicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products, and in food processing. Nonionizing radiation has been used in surface decontamination, as on the packaging sector. 

Although radiation techniques, as the other traditional or emerging techniques, can impair alterations that can modify the chemical composition and the nutritional value of foods, these changes depend on the food composition, the irradiation dose and factors such as temperature and presence or absence of oxygen in the irradiating environment. The aim of this chapter is to discuss retention or loss of vitamins and minerals in several food products submitted to a radiation process (gamma irradiation, short wave ultraviolet, microwave, and pulsed electric fields).

Nutritional value and quality of food products are very important for a healthy life of human beings. Various modern thermal and nonthermal application technologies such as pulsed light, pulsed electric field, high and low hydrostatic pressure, microwave, and ohmic heating have been used to improve food products characteristics. In recent years, ultrasonic applications have been used for food processing. 


The ultrasonic is defined as sound waves with a frequency exceeding the human hearing limit. Based on the frequency range of ultrasonic waves, it can be used in many industrial applications including the processing of food. Applications of high-power ultrasonic with low frequency aim to improve the quality of food products. Low-power ultrasonic with high-frequency applications are used for nondestructive quality evaluation of physicochemical properties of food. 

The most important advantages of ultrasonic technologies are the low cost of food processing, low power consumption, simplicity compared to other technologies, suitability for the treatment of solid and liquid food, and environmental safeness and friendliness, thus becoming a promising technology for monitoring and improving quality of food products. The main objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the principal and recent applications of ultrasonic waves to improve food product quality.

Case Studies of Small-Medium Food Enterprises around the World- Major Constraints and Benefits from the Implementation of Food Safety Management Systems

Global food safety and security are key principles to be followed in the context of the
implementation of food safety management systems. The objective of this paper is to assess the contemporary developments of Food Safety Management System standards (FSMS) worldwide and to identify the primary constraints and advantages associated with their implementation by small and medium-sized enterprises across different regions. 

The effectiveness of these systems has also been evaluated. 116 case studies have been employed across developing and developed regions worldwide across 27 primary food sectors. 

After the implementation of FSMS, there was a significant increase in the percentage of companies that have implemented the international FSMS, both in developed (16.7% to 63.9%) and developing countries (26.6% to 48.1%). Certification has also increased from 34.2% to 59.6% in the total sample, namely from 33.3% to 61.1% in developed countries and from 34.6% to 59.0% in developing countries. There was a significant increase in medium vs. small company size (57.1% to 62.3%, p = 0.046), only in developing countries. 

Food safety culture and manager leadership implementation were increased to over 80% after FSMS implementation in both developed and developing countries (p < 0.001). Training, resources, and technology adequacy were also increased in all companies (p < 0.001).

The problem of food-borne outbreaks has built a challenge against the food and health regulatory authorities to control the pathogenic microorganisms. Chemical preservative has created some health problems in foods, so the recent trend is towards the use of natural antimicrobials in foods. Plants are valuable source of bioactive molecules exhibiting antimicrobial activities. The plant antimicrobial compounds have diverse chemical nature such as alkaloids, phenolics, terpenes, terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oil, etc. 

Many plant antimicrobials possess antimicrobial activity against pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. But variation in effectiveness of these compounds against microorganisms in laboratory system and in real food systems is major determinant in their food use. Several plant extract or purified compounds are part of human diet since thousands of years. Although some plant compounds enjoy the status of generally recognised as safe (GRAS), typical toxicological information of their use in food is not available. So the improvement in cost-effective isolation and toxicological information of these compounds is helpful in their use as biopreservative in foods.

**A Guide to Calculating the Shelf Life of Foods**

**What is shelf life?**

Shelf life is a guide for the consumer of the period of time that food can be kept before it starts
to deteriorate, provided any stated storage conditions have been followed.
The shelf life of a product begins from the time the food is prepared or manufactured. Its length
is dependent on many factors including the types of ingredients, manufacturing process, type of
packaging and how the food is stored. It is indicated by labelling the product with a date mark.


**Is the shelf life of food related to food safety?**

Shelf life testing describes how long a food will retain its quality during storage. Controlling the pathogen content (safety) of foods should be achieved by using a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system.
Predictive modelling or challenge testing can be used to assess pathogen growth.
However, food safety and product shelf life are inextricably linked. During the shelf life of a food it should:
*  Remain safe to eat
*  Keep its appearance, odour, texture and flavour
*  Meet any nutritional claims provided on the label


**Content of this Guide**

Due to the increasing scarcity of water, wastewater treatment and water conditioning are one of the major future issues. Together with the need to apply highly accessible abundant materials and the demand to replace fossil-based chemicals with sustainable compounds from renewable resources, chitosan (CS) provides some of the solutions to obtain these goals and combines both, abundance and sustainability. Hence, the focus of this review is on the application of CS in wastewater treatment providing advantages and drawbacks in using CS in contrast to chitin. We herewith present the application of CS for coagulation/flocculation purposes, whether as native compound, as functionalized molecule or as blend, respectively, composite. The heavy metal, respectively, dye removal is an additional theme to be addressed in the body of the text. The third topic of this review contains the application of CS blends or composites in order to prepare membrane materials for water purification or conditioning. Together with a summary of the recent study, we discuss these findings and possible consequences for future works. In addition, we provide some theoretical background of the processes that CS is involved in and state some mechanistic insights.

Nanostructured colloids are materials with at least one dimension in the nanometer range (<100 nm). Such materials find multiple and exciting applications in various areas of food science, and can lead to development of new and innovative food products and ingredients. 

Nanostructured colloids can be naturally present in food or they can be synthetically manufactured and added during different stages of food production and packaging. The building blocks of nanostructures in food consist of organic molecules (proteins, lipids, saccharides), inorganics (metal and metal oxides, carbon-based materials, clays) and combined organic and inorganic compounds. 

Some examples of nanostructured colloids naturally occurring in food include fat globules in homogenized milk, casein micelles, β-lactoglobulin fibers in milk. 

Synthetically manufactured colloids (artificial and engineered) include nanoemulsions, nanomicelles, nanocapsules, nanofoams, nanoliposomes, nanogels, nanofibers, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. 

Synthetically manufactured nanostructures are normally added in food to enhance solubility, improve bioavailability, protect the biologically active compounds from degradation, increase the shelf life, color, flavor, and add nutritional value. Exciting fields of applications of nanostructured colloids in food science comprise: functional food ingredients, food additives, food supplements, food packaging and nanosensors.

Peeled shrimps were dried separately using an air-oven dryer and a tunnel solar dryer. The drying profile of shrimp meat was determined in the two drying systems by monitoring moisture loss over the drying period. 

Changes in color, proximate composition, and rehydration capacity were assessed. The rate of moisture removal during solar drying was faster than the air-oven drying. 


The development of red color during drying was comparable among the two methods, but solar-dried shrimps appeared darker () than the air-oven-dried (). Chemical analysis indicated that protein and fat made up nearly 20% and 2% (wb) of the shrimp meat, respectively. 

Protein and ash content of shrimp meat dried under the two dryer types were comparable but fat was significantly () higher in oven-dried meat (2.1%), compared to solar-dried meat (1.5%). Although rehydration behavior of shrimp from the two drying systems followed a similar pattern, solar-dried shrimp absorbed moisture more rapidly. 

The results have demonstrated that different approaches to drying may affect the physical and nutritional quality of shrimp meat differently.

Australian meat has a reputation around the world for excellent shelf life. The Australian meat industry produces meat products with shelf lives ranging from a few days (entire cuts, roasts and ground meats) to several months (vacuum-packed primals) to more than one year (frozen manufacturing meat). The industry services domestic and export markets in the retail and further processing sectors, all of which impose specifications or standards which relate to shelf life.

The purpose of this book is to explain the important elements that contribute to shelf life so that everyone in the supply chain can do their part to maintain a superior standard. It is also intended for Australian meat customers so that they can understand the technical aspects of the product, what to expect of Australian meat and how to set appropriate criteria for product acceptance.

As will be seen from the Contents page, the scope of this book is wide.

It provides up-to-date information on the shelf life of Australian meat for a range of users who operate in the technical, regulatory and marketing spheres. To satisfy this broad spectrum of readers, each section is ‘paced’, progressing from a basic level and ending with the latest research work; a reference list is provided at the end of each section for those who wish to read further.
This second edition contains numerous research updates from CSIRO and University of Tasmania on shelf life of primals and sub primals, and on interventions. The shelf life predictor has also been developed to a stage where it has great potential value, especially for emerging markets where the
cold chain infrastructure is not well developed.

Techniques of pathogenic microorganism identification by DNA using PCR are recommended and required for sanitary and customs control. It is important to know the diversity of contaminating microorganisms in honey, especially due to disseminate pathogenic microorganisms in the international traded marketing. In contrast, beneficial microorganisms such as yeasts can remain latently in this product waiting for the moment in which the environment is suitable for their development.

Among the beneficial bacteria found in honeybee products, we can mention some lactic acid bacteria that act as prebiotics when ingested. The microorganisms in the digestive tract of honeybees are important for their health.

This study was carried out on Syrian olive oil (SOO) produced from  *Olea europaea*  L. cv Kaissy, to determine the influence of different doses of gamma irradiation treatments (0, 1, 2 and 3 kGy) and various storage periods (0, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months) on fatty acid (FA) content.


As a result, the composition of FAs was determined as palmitic acid (C16:0) (13.11%); palmitoleic acid (C16:1) (0.90%); stearic acid (C18:0) (3.08%); oleic acid (C18:1) (71.37%); linoleic acid (C18:2) (10.31%) and linolenic acid (C18:3) (1.22%), in order of relative abundance. Gamma irradiation significantly increased (p<0.01) the saturated fatty acid (SFA) and decreased (p<0.01) the unsaturated fatty acids (USFA).

These results indicated that the USFA/SFA ratio of the virgin olive oil was markedly decreased by irradiation at 1, 2 and 3 kGy. Long storage has a significant (p<0.05) effect in SFAs and USFAs in both irradiated and non-irradiated olive oil samples.

2799,1,"Colour is a key component to enhance the ultimate appetizing value and consumer acceptance towards foods and beverages. Synthetic food colours have been increasingly used than natural food colours by food manufacturers to attain certain properties such as low cost, improved appearance, high colour intensity, more colour stability, and uniformity. Varied foods and beverages available in the market may contain some nonpermitted synthetic colours and overuse of permitted synthetic colours.

This may lead to severe health problems such as mutations, cancers, reduced haemoglobin concentrations, and allergic reactions. According to the Food Act, 2011 (No. 26 of 1980), Sri Lanka, only nine synthetic food colours are permitted and the colour concentration cannot exceed 100 ppm as a single component or in combination.

This study aims to identify the synthetic food colours in confectioneries and beverages available in Jaffna district, Sri Lanka. Randomly collected 110 samples from eleven Medical Officers Of Health areas in Jaffna district were analyzed by using thin layer chromatography and UV-visible spectrophotometry.

According to the results, 100% beverages and 85% confectioneries contained permitted synthetic food colours. Out of all, 7% of the confectioneries did not contain any synthetic food colour and 8% of the confectioneries contained nonpermitted colours which do not comply with any of the permitted synthetic food colours.


Tartrazine (E102) (41%) was the most used synthetic food colour in both confectioneries and beverages.

Moreover, 60% of the beverages violated the label requirement without including proper colour ingredients. The study concluded that there is a high tendency to use synthetic food colours in confectioneries and beverages and some confectioneries contain unidentified colours including a textile dye.


Therefore, the implementation of regulations and awareness programs of food colours for consumers and food manufacturers are highly recommended.

Fish and seafoods are a highly perishable product due to the biochemical composition and the high microbial load on the skin and gills of fish. The natural microflora that is more adopted to low temperatures results in lower thermal bacterial shock at the storage temperature. 

The development of new fish processing techniques is required because the demand for fish or seafood with minimum changes in sensory Biochemical and nutritional quality. This has led to the advent of hurdle technology in the field of seafood technology. 


Hurdle technology is the combined use of several preservation methods to make a product shelf-stable, to improve quality and to provide additional safety.

This technology is used in many countries of the world, including India. The factors used for food preservation is called as hurdles. A combination of hurdle such as high temperature, refrigeration, irradiation, drying and smoking etc. are applied to eliminate the growth of microorganism. 

The application of several hurdle may reduce the rate of fish spoilage caused by spoilage microbe. The objective of this book chapters is focus on the preservative effect of hurdles technology on the quality and shelf-life fish and fishery products with recent, combined updated information.

11642,1,Hello Sir. Can i share my ideas with you?
178,1,"## Introduction

Shiga toxin-producing  *Escherichia coli*  (STEC) cause severe foodborne illnesses, with patient outcomes including bloody diarrhoea, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and death. Among serotypes of STEC,  *E. coli*  O157:H7 draws the major attention because it has been implicated in more foodborne illness outbreaks than other serotypes. In recent years, increasing awareness of non-O157 STEC as causes of human illness has prompted expanded clinical diagnosis, investigation, and surveillance of these organisms (Gould  *et al* ., 2013). In addition, more than 380 other serotypes of STEC have been isolated from humans (Karmali  *et al* ., 2010). Six  *E. coli*  O groups comprising 13 serotypes have been known to be responsible for over 70% of non-O157 STEC infections in the USA in the period between 1983 and 2002 (Brooks  *et al* ., 2005). Strains of non-O157 STEC cause illnesses similar to those caused by O157 STEC, and the virulence is associated with the presence of virulence genes such as  *stx* 1 or  *stx* 2 (Shiga toxin),  *eae*  (intimin),  *hly*  (enterohemolysin),  *nle*  [non-locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded effector protein],  *saa*  (STEC auto-agglutinating adhesion), and  *subAB*  (subtilase cytotoxin) (Paton et al., 2004; Mingle  *et al* ., 2012). These virulence gene profiles have been successfully revealed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Monaghan  *et al* ., 2011). Of the several virulence factors involved in pathogenicity, Shiga toxin plays a major role in causing severe illnesses in humans (Thorpe, 2004). The Stx family is comprised of Stx1 and Stx2. Stx1 is highly homogeneous, while Stx2 has several variants (Ju  *et al* ., 2012). Both Stx1 and Stx2 are enterotoxic in the intestinal segment model leading to death in mice and rabbits and are cytotoxic to various cell culture models. Cytotoxicity assays have been developed to measure the viability of mammalian cells based on cell proliferation or death. One parameter in evaluating cell death is the integrity of the cell membrane, which can be measured by the cytoplasmic enzyme activity released by damaged cells. Vero cell cytotoxicity assay has been used for the diagnosis of STEC infection (Paton and Paton, 2003). Vero cells have a high concentration of Gb3 receptors on their plasma membranes as well as Gb4 (the preferred receptor for Stx2e) and thus are highly sensitive to all known Stx variants.

Food manufacturing process is designed to interfere with bacterial homeostasis through inactivation of the bacteria by exposure to adverse conditions. It has been known that STEC responds to sub-lethal environmental stresses (Montet  *et al* ., 2009). A number of sub-lethal processing stresses that bacteria may experience during food processing including osmotic stress, mildly acidic environment, and chlorine treatment may enable their survival at the subsequent processing and adverse environmental conditions and upregulation of the virulence-associated genes (Williams et al., 2000; House  *et al* ., 2009). In other words, bacteria recovering or recovered from sub-lethal stresses may exhibit altered expression of virulence-associated genes as a result of injury repair (Price et al., 2000; Olesen and Jespersen, 2010).

Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) dissolved in water is widely used in the food industry to sanitize equipment and reduce microbial contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables (Erkmen, 2010; Althaus  *et al* ., 2012). Microorganisms previously exposed to chlorine treatment may survive and be ingested by consumers. Based on recent whole-genome microarrays for  *E. coli*  O157:H7 strains linked to two foodborne illness outbreaks caused by fresh produce—Sakai, a clinical isolate from the 1996 sprout outbreak in Japan (Michino  *et al* ., 1999), and TW14359, an isolate from the 2006 spinach outbreak in the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006)—a total of 240 genes in Sakai and 140 genes in TW14359 were found to be differentially regulated (Deng  *et al* ., 2011). Despite several transcriptomic analyses, none of the studies revealed that sub-lethal chlorine stress might alter the virulence of pathogenic  *E. coli* . Moreover, although non-O157 STEC have been increasingly identified as clinically significant, there is a lack of information as to how non-O157 STEC responds to stress and the effect of stress on the cytotoxicity, which may be an indication of the levels of Shiga-toxin production and virulence. The purpose of this study was to address if there is any quantitative change in Shiga toxin production by non-O157 STEC under specified stress conditions as determined by Vero-cytotoxicity assays.

## Materials and Methods

### STEC strains

Six  *E. coli*  non-O157 strains—O26:H11 (05-6544), O103:H1 (04/62), O104:H4 (2009EL-2050), O111:NM (98–8338), O121:NM (03-406), and O145:NM (03-4699)—were kindly provided by Dr. Pina Fratamico (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Services, Wyndmoor, PA).  *E. coli*  O157:H7 strains of ATCC 43888, 43889, and 43890 were used as a cocktail mix. Each strain was grown overnight in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD) at 37°C on a shaker with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic growth (~108 CFU/ml).

### Osmotic stress

Stock solutions of various water activities were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment by using 8.5, 7, 5.25, and 3.5 g of NaCl (Mallinckrodt Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) to obtain different levels of water activities (aw 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.98) in 100 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Biosciences). Water activity was measured using an AquaLab water activity metre (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) calibrated with saturated salt solutions of known water activity. Ten millilitres of the overnight  *E. coli*  cell suspension cultures was pelleted (2800 ×  *g* , 2 min, 4°C), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and diluted in sterile distilled water (DW) to a final concentration of ~103 CFU/ml. Samples were incubated at 22°C and samplings were performed after incubation for 7, 14, and 21 days. At each sampling point, 1 ml of cell suspension was removed and serially diluted in PBS. The cell counts were determined by plating 0.1 ml of solution onto tryptic soy agar (TSA; BD Biosciences) plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h, and the typical colonies were counted.

### Acidic stress

TSB was acidified to pH 7, 6, 5, or 4 using 1 N hydrochloric acid (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). The acidified TSB was sterilized using 0.22-µm Corning filter units (Costar, Corning, NY).  *E. coli*  cells were inoculated separately into each of the prepared acidified PBS solutions (10 ml) to achieve a final cell concentration of ca. 103CFU/ml. The inoculated broth was incubated at 22°C for 21 d. Samples were drawn after incubation for 7, 14, and 21 days. At each sampling point, 1 ml of each cell suspension was serially diluted in PBS. Three appropriate dilutions (0.1 ml) of each tested sample were plated on duplicate TSA plates. The inoculated plates were incubated for 24–48 h at 37°C before colonies were counted.

### Chlorine stress

Stock solutions of NaOCl were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment by diluting 5% NaOCl (Fisher Scientific) in sterile distilled water (22°C) to give various concentrations of NaOCl. Each strain of STEC at 8 log CFU/ml was exposed to NaOCl (1, 2, and 5 ppm) at 22°C for 24 h. Ten millilitres of STEC cell suspension cultures grown overnight at 37°C was pelleted (2800 ×  *g* , 2 min, 4°C), washed twice with PBS, and diluted in chlorinated distilled water to a final concentration of ~107 CFU/ml. During incubation in chlorinated distilled water for 24 h, 1 ml of liquid from each tube was immediately transferred to test tubes containing PBS and filter-sterilized neutralizing reagent (2 µg/ml of sodium thiosulfate, Fisher Scientific) at each sampling period (1, 6, and 24 h). The cells after the treatments were enumerated by plating 0.1 ml of solution onto TSA agar plates and incubating at 37°C for 24 h. The STEC cells surviving the exposure of 2 ppm chlorine for 24 h were collected and subjected to chlorine exposure treatment for 24 h. After four consecutive exposures, the fourth generation of each chlorine-stressed STEC cells (G3) and each generation (G0, G1, G2, and G3) was stored and frozen until they were used for cytotoxicity assays.

### Quantification of virulence-associated genes

One millilitre of the bacterial cells grown overnight at 37°C was harvested by centrifugation at 17 900 ×  *g*  for 3 min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was subjected to bacterial RNA isolation using RiboPure™-Bacteria Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted using TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8). The concentration of RNA was evaluated by the absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm using the Nanodrop® ND100 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). DNase I was treated according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to cDNA synthesis to avoid residual DNA contamination.

RNA (2 µg) was subsequently used to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cDNA (10 ng) was added to 25 µl PCR reaction mixture containing 2x Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and 250 nM of each primer ( *stx* 1,  *stx* 2,  *eae* , and  *mdh* ). PCR for  *stx* 1,  *stx* 2,  *eae* , and  *mdh*  genes was carried out using the primer pairs (Fratamico  *et al* ., 2011) as described in Table 1. PCR samples were amplified using a 7500 Fast RT-PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) at a cycle of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, then 55°C for 1 min. Non-DNA templates were included as negative controls for PCR reaction. The housekeeping gene  *mdh*  was used as an internal control to normalize the  *Ct* (threshold cycle) values of  *stx1* ,  *stx2* , and  *eae* . The relative expression of these virulence genes in stressed cells was calculated by normalizing to the expression level of corresponding genes in control cells. The Δ *Ct* , ΔΔ *Ct* , and the 2ˉfx values were calculated as described by Pfaffl (2001).

### Vero-cytotoxicity assays

Cytotoxicity was determined using Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81, African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used to quantify cell death based on the measurement of LDH released from the cytosol of damaged cells into the extracellular media. LDH is a stable cytoplasmic enzyme present inside the cytosol of all types of bacterial cells. It is released to the extracellular space when the plasma membrane is damaged (Korzeniewski and Callewaert, 1983). The LDH activity is determined by a two-step enzymatic test. The first step is the reduction of NAD+ to NADH/H+ by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In a second step, the catalyst (diaphorase) transfers H/H+ from NADH/H+ to the tetrazolium salt 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride, which is reduced to a red formazan (Lappalainen  *et al* ., 1994). For assays, monolayer of subconfluent Vero cells in 96-well plates was seeded in 96-well plates. STEC cells (G3 or control) grown overnight under regular BHI broth at late exponential or early stationary phase were collected and filter-sterilized to obtain supernatants including Shiga toxin released to extracellular media. Vero cells were exposed to filter-sterilized supernatants for 24 h or up to 48 h at 37°C in 5% CO2incubator. After incubation, the release of LDH was measured using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The spontaneous LDH release (=low control) was determined by adding 100 µl of assay medium that contains 1% foetal bovine serum without pyruvate to wells containing 100 µl of cells in assay medium. Maximum LDH release (=high control) was determined by adding 100 µl of Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution (2% Triton X-100 in assay medium) to each well containing 100 μl of cells in assay medium. The amount of LDH released was determined by transferring 100 µl of supernatant from each well to wells of optically clear 96-well, flat-bottomed microplates (Corning), adding 100 µl of reaction mixture to wells, incubating at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and measuring absorption at 492 nm using a reference wavelength of 620 nm with Saffire2 microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC). In the cytotoxicity LDH detection assay, the percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated using optical density readings:

 

Cytotoxicity(%)=[(experiment value–low control)/(high control–low control)]×100Cytotoxicity(%)=[(experiment value–low control)/(high control–low control)]×100

Measured cytotoxicity was normalized by the cell population when the supernatants were collected. Each sample was tested in triplicates. At least three independent experiments were performed for each sample.

### Statistical analysis

Each experiment was conducted in duplicate and repeated three times. Data collected from the study were analysed using the Student’s  *t* -test of the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Significance of differences in survival among the tested STEC strains under various treatments was determined at α = 0.05.

## Results and Discussion

### Survival under osmotic stress

The populations of three strain cocktails of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 and six strains of non-O157 STEC (O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, O111:NM, O121:NM, and O145:NM) subjected to four different levels of osmotic stresses (aw 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.98) at 22°C for 3 weeks are shown in Figure 1A. Most foods have water activity of 0.95 or above and aw 0.99 was not included in this experiment because of similar outcome to control in growth. At aw 0.95 and 0.96, all tested strains fell to undetectable levels with little variation after a week of incubation. At aw 0.97, 7.6 log CFU/ml of  *E. coli*  O145:NM strain survived the osmotic stress during 21 days of incubation, while the other strains were not detected after one week.  *E. coli*  O111:NM was most sensitive to osmotic stress; even at aw 0.98, it did not endure the osmolarity for 7 days. The other strains showed similar growth for 21 days. Previous studies (Baylis  *et al* ., 2004; Hiramatsu  *et al* ., 2005) have shown that  *E. coli*  O157 and non-O157 STEC strains had similar growth patterns under osmotic stresses. In our study, most of non-O157 and O157 STEC showed similar patterns of growth, which is consistent with previous findings except for  *E. coli*  O145:NM, which exhibited significantly higher growth at aw 0.97 when compared with other strains. It was suggested that an increase in environmental osmotic pressure disrupts metabolic activities by losing water to the exterior, which leads to the breakage of STEC cell membrane (Beney  *et al* ., 2004; Yoo and Chen, 2010).

### Survival under acidic stress

Seven STEC strains at initial bacterial populations of 3 log CFU/ml were exposed to four different levels of pH (4, 5, 6, and 7) at 22°C for 3 weeks (Figure 1B). Foods associated with recent outbreaks including tomatoes (pH 4–5), ground beef (pH 5–6), Romaine lettuce (pH 6), and spinach (pH 6–7) were considered to choose different levels of pHs. At pH 4, most strains did not survive after 7 days, while 2.2 log CFU/ml of  *E. coli*  O103:H1 survived after 7 days and 1.8 log CFU/ml remained after 14 days. Over pH 5, most strains did not show any difficulty in growth, where  *E. coli* O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O111:NM had significantly ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) less growth than other strains during the first week. Acidic stress is a stress that STEC may be exposed to in the environment, during food processing, or in food matrices. Typically, different organic acids including benzoate, sorbate, propionate, and citrate are present in combination with mild acidic conditions (pH 4–7). Survival of STEC under the influence of pH was investigated mainly due to the inherent resistance of STEC. Exposed to simulating gastric acidity,  *E. coli*  O157 was shown to be more resistant to acidic conditions than non-O157 STEC such as  *E. coli*  O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O111:H8 (Bergholz and Whittam, 2007), which is consistent with our results that these two strains had significantly less growth than other strains at pH 5 in the first week of exposure.

### Survival after chlorine stress

After STEC cells at 8 log CFU/ml were exposed to NaOCl (1, 2, and 5 ppm) at 22°C for 24 h, the survivor curve of each strain was plotted and compared using Student’s  *t* -test (Figure 2A). There were significant differences ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) in the surviving populations of STEC during chlorine exposures. Significantly higher populations were observed for  *E. coli*  O26:H11,  *E. coli*  O103:H1,  *E. coli*  O104:H4, and  *E. coli*  O145:NM strains than others including  *E. coli*  O157:H7 under 2 ppm of NaOCl. The populations of  *E. coli*  O26:H11 and  *E. coli*  O103:H1 were 6.1 and 5.6 log CFU/ml, respectively, while other strains were less than 3 log CFU/ml after 24 h. For 1 ppm of chlorine treatment,  *E. coli*  O104:H4 showed significantly the highest survival among the strains ( *P*  &lt; 0.05). After 24 h of exposure, cells were washed by PBS, collected, and repeatedly exposed to chlorine. The STEC strains were designated as G0, G1, G2, and G3according the number (1–4) of exposure to chlorine stresses. To address the acquired resistance after sub-lethal stress, stressed STEC strains from each generation were exposed to 2 ppm of chlorine for 48 h (Figure 2B). The fourth generation (G3) of each strain showed significantly ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) higher survival rate than other generations except for  *E. coli*  O111: NM and  *E. coli*  O121:NM, indicating that G3 is relatively most resistant to sub-lethal chlorine. Activity of chlorine can strictly depend on the matrix where there is other organic material available in the environment. However, we assume that the surface of the equipments in food processing facilities has been taken care of by sanitation and cleaning procedure required by the pre-requisite program accompanying Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point. Some STEC may endure those procedures and remain on the surface where organic matter is absent. Among the intervention strategies to mitigate STEC risk in food production, chlorine is widely used as a washing or sanitizing agent. In this study, the chlorine stress conditions simulate the conditions that the STEC may encounter during food production or in the processing environment. Consecutive exposures of surviving  *E. coli*  O157:H7 to sub-lethal amounts of chlorine may induce expression of  *ycfR* , which is involved in the response to chlorine stress (Hou  *et al* ., 2013). It promotes attachment and colonization of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 in lettuce and leads to better growth. In other studies,  *ycfR*  was upregulated by tenfold under chlorine treatment (Zhang et al., 2007; Mermod  *et al* ., 2012). Under chlorine stress, this gene has been shown to be involved in the surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation (Gonzalez-Escobedo and Gunn, 2013). This gene was also known to contribute to surface attachment and survival of  *Salmonella enterica*  during post-harvest minimal processing of fresh produce (Salazar  *et al* ., 2013).

### Effect of stresses on the relative expression of virulence-associated genes

Several virulence-associated genes in STEC have been identified (Kaper  *et al* ., 2004). Among them,  *stx* 1,  *stx* 2, and  *eae*  have been selected to investigate the effects of chlorine stresses on the relative expression of these genes by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3A, consecutive sub-lethal chlorine treatment against O103:H1, O104:H4, O145:NM, and O157:H7 resulted in significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase (&gt;1.4 fold) in relative gene expression of  *stx* 1 compared to control cells. Similarly, chlorine-stressed cells of O103:H1 showed significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase (&gt;2 fold) in relative gene expression of  *stx* 2 compared to control cells, and cells of O104:H4 and O145:NM showed slight increase (1.27–1.38 fold), while O26:H11 showed large increase (1.92 fold) in  *stx2*  (Figure 3B). On the other hand, chlorine-stressed cells of O111: NM, O121:NM, and O157:H7 showed similar or slightly less expression of selected genes when compared to control cells. Relative gene expression of  *eae*  was mostly similar to the patterns in  *stx1*  and  *stx2* , except for stressed cells of O111: NM with twofold increases in  *eae*  compared to control cells (Figure 3C). Studies have reported that the expression of virulence-associated genes is connected to better survival or growth of STEC in fresh produce. Robinson  *et al* . (2006) suggested that the  *stx* 2 mutant of a STEC strain was less effective in adherence to epithelial cells than its wild-type counterpart. In addition, the mutant revealed a lower capacity to colonize mouse intestine, indicating that Shiga toxin promotes intestinal colonization, possibly also in humans. However, Sheng  *et al* . (2006) proposed that  *E. coli*  O157:H7 requires the presence of intimin, Tir, and pO157 to colonize cattle at the terminus of rectal mucosa, while the colonization preceded normally in the absence of the active  *stx* genes (Los  *et al* ., 2012). When the pathogen has abrupt shifting in its environment, it induces a package of stress response genes. A recent study (Kocharunchitt  *et al* ., 2014) showed that sudden downshift of aw induced global changes in growth kinetics, nutrient metabolism, cell structure components, and general stress response as well as virulence properties. Changes in relative transcriptional level of virulence-associated genes may be dependent on the general stress response to chlorine stress. Our findings suggest that chlorine stress may induce the expression of virulence-associated genes through potential mechanisms by stress response genes.

### Effect of stresses on the cytotoxicity in Vero cells

Filtered supernatant samples from stressed (G3) and control STEC cells were tested for the presence of Shiga toxin using the LDH assay. Vero-cytotoxicity increased over time in control and stressed cells, indicating time dependence of toxin production (Figure 4A). The cytotoxicity peaked after 24 h of growth in both stressed and control cells except for  *E. coli*  O103:H1, with the highest production observed at 36 h for control cells and 48 h for stressed cells during incubation. Therefore, a 24-h growth was chosen for experiments. To address the difference in the cytotoxicity between stressed and control cells, supernatant samples from both groups were collected after 24 h of growth and assayed for Vero-cytotoxicity (Figure 4B). There was significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05) increase in cytotoxicity (%) between stressed and control cells in  *E. coli*  O26:H11 (40%),  *E. coli*  O103:H1 (50%),  *E. coli*  O104:H4 (60%), and  *E. coli* O145:NM (25%). Stressed  *E. coli*  O157:H7 cells also showed an increase in cytotoxicity compared to control cells, but this increase was not statistically significant ( *P*  &lt; 0.05). It was noted that supernatants from stressed and control cells showed an increase in Vero-cytotoxicity over time for the first 24 h. It seems that the damaged cell membrane may enable more toxin release while minimizing the wound of cytosolic organs. An investigation of bacterial recovery from 5-day starvation and chlorine treatment showed that there was no difference between control and stressed STEC in Vero-cytotoxicity (Kolling and Matthews, 2007). The main reason for STECs to produce Shiga toxin might be to protect themselves from either predators or hostile mammalian immunological system (Los  *et al* ., 2012). A similar outcome was shown in a study where  *Campylobacter jejuni*  injured by sub-lethal exposure to chlorine showed a low invasive potential for HeLa cells (Terzieva and McFeters, 1992). In contrast, a virulence study based on mouse LD50, adhesion, and invasion assays conducted in  *Yersinia enterocolitica* ,  *Salmonella typhimurium* , and enterotoxigenic  *E. coli*  showed that the chlorine treatment weakened their virulence (LeChevallier  *et al* ., 1985). Increased release of Shiga toxin production by STEC may benefit the organisms by providing protective barriers to defend themselves against the hosts’ immune systems and prolong the life span of invading microorganisms. Transcriptomic responses of  *Salmonella enteritidis*  and  *S* .  *typhimurium*  to chlorine stress revealed that half of the genes in  *Salmonella*  pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 were downregulated in  *S. typhimurium*  under chlorine treatments, suggesting that chlorine stress may affect the biosynthesis and assembly of type III secretion system leading to reduced virulence in  *S. typhimurium* , while no significant change in the expression of genes in SPI was seen in  *S. enteritidis*  under the same condition (Wang  *et al* ., 2010). Additionally, osmotic stress by the use of salt in meat processing enhanced the production of Shiga toxin based on qRT-PCR and Western blot (Harris  *et al* ., 2012). Lee  *et al* . (2012) suggested that strains which have different genotypes ( *stx1* ,  *stx2* , or both) may respond distinctly to the same stress. They showed that a strain with greater resistance to one type of stress tended to have greater resistance to the other types of stresses. In the present study, the result of higher expression of  *stx1*  or  *stx2* in stressed O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM agrees with their findings. In this study, a cocktail mix of  *E. coli*  O157:H7 consisting of strain 43888 (lack of  *stx1*  and  *stx2* ), 43889 ( *stx2* -positive), and 43890 ( *stx1* -positive) (Jothikumar and Griffiths, 2002) was used as a control to normalize the relative contribution of each toxin to cytotoxic effect in Vero cell culture. It seemed to have contributed to a larger variation of cytotoxicity in control cells of O157:H7 (Figure 4). The relative abundance of  *stx1*  and  *stx2* , or  *eae*  in stressed non-O157 STECs of selected strains may enhance the Vero-cytotoxicity in those cells when compared with those of unstressed control cells.

## Conclusions

In this study, we compared the level of cytotoxicity between unstressed and stressed STEC. Results suggest that repetitive exposure of STEC to sub-lethal chlorine treatment may enhance the levels of Vero-cytotoxicity in STEC O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM which may lead to an increased virulence. It was supported by the increased expression of virulence-associated genes in STEC O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM. We assume that sub-lethal chlorine treatment may bring about more risks in terms of cytotoxicity. However, to better assess the potential risks, profound biochemical experiments will be needed to sophisticatedly address the factors involved in the release of Shiga toxin and the increase in the expression of virulence-associated genes."

Cashew nuts - 92 grams
Seasoning powder - 14 grams (pre mixed with maltodextrin)

Principle: It is based on the comparison of the sample taken from bread by dissolving in petroleum ether and not bleaching.

Tools and Equipment: General laboratory equipment and materials, precision laboratory balance.

Chemical: Petroleum ether

Application: Bleaching with flour known to be not bleaching is taken from the sample to be determined by bleaching. 100 ml of petroleum ether were added on both and shake with closed mouth for 5 minutes. It is then allowed to crash for 12 hours. At the end of the period, both flasks are shaken for 5 minutes and allowed to settle again. The liquid remaining on the precipitated portion is filtered (avoiding as much fly as possible). The first 10 ml of the filtrate is filtered again and the filtrate colors are compared.

Calculation: The colors of the filtrate of the flours which were not bleached were darker than the ones of the bleached flours (TS4500 / April 1985).

Soybean flour is an additive used to whiten bread.

-DATEM, tartaric acid esters of mono diglycerides are an additive used for the smooth internal structure of the bread, but it is not accepted because it changes the flavor of the bread.

- Cysteine ​​causes the bread dough to become weak and soft. more bran content and salt content in the dough dough of wheat grown in Turkey is low, there is a problem, such as weak. Adding cysteine ​​on top of this will adversely affect the structure of the bread.

Furthermore, these three additives, including food additives, are not in compliance with the food communiqué and are not suitable for use.

-The use of glucose oxidase instead of vitamin C in the production of bread adversely affects the flavor of bread and is not suitable for use. Glucose oxidase forms hydrogen peroxide using glucose and causes spoilage of taste.

- Bread wheat modification is made hexaploid to obtain wheats more resistant to fungal infection.

ELISA or PCR approaches are used to detect all these undesirable contributions. These detect the presence / absence. If a quantitative result is desired, real-time PCR is used.

ELISA (Enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay) tests for the presence of specific proteins using the binding property between antigen and antibody. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is based on the identification of DNA sequences transferred to cereal. These methods can provide information about the quantity (percentage) in the sample. The first method approved in the EU is the PCR-based assay, in which many GMOs approved for presentation to the market can be detected (Lipp et al., 1999).

The sample from the bread is extracted; mechanic shredding, chemical application or enzymatic shredding. The extracted sample is then purified: extraction / precipitation, chromatography, centrifugation, affinity column separation (Zimmermann et al., 1998)."

Lactic acid bacteria alone or with special adjunct probiotic strains are inevitable for the preparation of various specific fermented and probiotic foods. 

Moreover, because of their growth and metabolism, the final products are preserved for a certain time. Growth dynamics of probiotic LAB and Fresco DVS 1010 in milk‐ and water‐based maize mashes with sucrose or flavours (chocolate, caramel and vanilla) were evaluated in this study. Although milk is typical growth medium for the LAB growth, observed strains showed sufficient growth in each of prepared mashes as well as they were able to maintain their content above 106 CFU ml-1 during storage period (6°C/21 d). 



Designed flavoured mashes were acceptable from the microbiological point of view, but according to the sensory evaluation they were provided with an attractive overall acceptability and are adequate alternative for celiac patients, people suffering from milk protein allergies or lactose intolerance.

1544,1,"Campylobacter infection, or campylobacteriosis, is an infectious disease caused by Campylobacter bacteria. It is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States. The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) indicates that about 14 cases are diagnosed each year for every 100,000 people. Many more cases go undiagnosed or unreported. CDC estimates Campylobacter infection affects more than 1.3 million people every year. Most cases are not part of recognized outbreaks, and more cases occur in summer than in winter.

What are the symptoms of Campylobacter infection?
People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. The diarrhea may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually start within two to five days after exposure and last about a week. Some infected people do not have any symptoms. In people with weakened immune systems, such as people with the blood disorders thalassemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, AIDS, or people receiving some kinds of chemotherapy, Campylobacter occasionally spreads to the bloodstream and causes a life-threatening infection.

What kind of germ is Campylobacter?
Campylobacter are bacteria that can make people and animals sick. Most human illness is caused by one species, called Campylobacter jejuni, but other species also can cause human illness.

How does food and water get contaminated with Campylobacter?
Many chickens, cows, and other birds and animals that show no signs of illness carry Campylobacter. Campylobacter can be carried in the intestines, liver, and giblets of animals and can be transferred to other edible parts of an animal when it’s slaughtered. In 2014, National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) testing found Campylobacter on 33% of raw chicken bought from retailers.

Milk can become contaminated when a cow has a Campylobacter infection in her udder or when milk is contaminated with manure. Other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can be can become contaminated through contact with soil containing feces from cows, birds, or other animals. Animal feces can also contaminate lakes and streams. Pasteurization of milk, washing or scrubbing of fruits and vegetables, and disinfection of drinking water helps prevent illness.

How do people get infected with Campylobacter bacteria?
It takes very few Campylobacter germs (fewer than 500) to make someone sick. That means a single drop of juice from raw chicken can have enough Campylobacter in it to infect someone.

Most Campylobacter infections are associated with eating raw or undercooked poultry or from contamination of other foods by these items. People can get infected when a cutting board that has been used to cut and prepare raw chicken isn’t washed before it is used to prepare foods that are served raw or lightly cooked, such as salad or fruit. People also can get infected through contact with the feces of a dog or cat. Campylobacter does not usually spread from one person to another.

Outbreaks of Campylobacter infections have been associated most often with poultry, raw (unpasteurized) dairy products, untreated water, and produce.

Campylobacter infection is common in the developing world, and people who travel abroad have a greater chance of becoming infected. About 1 in 5 Campylobacter infections reported to the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) are associated with international travel.

Even more rarely, people may become infected through contaminated blood during a transfusion.

How is Campylobacter infection diagnosed and treated?
Campylobacter infection is diagnosed when a laboratory test detects Campylobacter bacteria in stool, body tissue, or fluids. The test could be a culture that isolates the bacteria or a rapid diagnostic test that detects genetic material of the bacteria.

Most people with Campylobacter infection recover without specific treatment. Patients should drink extra fluids as long as the diarrhea lasts. Antibiotics are needed only for patients who are very ill or at high risk for severe disease, such as people with severely weakened immune systems;  the blood disorders thalassemia and hypogammaglobulinemia; or AIDS; and people receiving chemotherapy.

Is Campylobacter infection serious?
Most people with a Campylobacter infection recover completely within a week, although they may shed (get rid of) Campylobacter bacteria in their stool for several weeks after recovery, which might result in person-to-person transmission. Campylobacter infection rarely results in long-term consequences. Some studies have estimated that 5–20% of people with Campylobacter infection develop irritable bowel syndrome for a limited time and 1–5% develop arthritis.

About 1 in every 1,000 reported Campylobacter illnesses leads to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS happens when a person’s immune system is triggered by an earlier infection, such as Campylobacter infection. GBS can lead to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis that can last for a few weeks to several years, and often requires intensive medical care. Most people recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage, and some have died of GBS. As many as 40% of GBS cases in the United States may be triggered by Campylobacter infection.

**CaCO3 or CCaO3**

Calcium carbonate appears as white, odorless powder or colorless crystals. Practically insoluble in water. Occurs extensive in rocks world-wide. Ground calcium carbonate (CAS: 1317-65-3) results directly from the mining of limestone. The extraction process keeps the carbonate very close to its original state of purity and delivers a finely ground product either in dry or slurry form.


Precipitated calcium carbonate (CAS: 471-34-1) is produced industrially by the decomposition of limestone to calcium oxide followed by subsequent recarbonization or as a by-product of the Solvay process (which is used to make sodium carbonate). Precipitated calcium carbonate is purer than ground calcium carbonate and has different (and tailorable) handling properties.

Calcium carbonate is a calcium salt with formula CCaO3. It has a role as an antacid, a food colouring, a food firming agent and a fertilizer. It is a calcium salt, a carbonate salt and a one-carbon compound.Calcium carbonate is a calcium salt with formula CCaO3.

## Abstract

Food safety is a complex topic, and the various market participants are involved, such as authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), consumer protection bodies and the media, have a very different, often emotionally charged perspective. This poses a particular challenge to producers and distributors when deciding on a method to deal with media attention on unhealthy food, with contaminations and residuals. There are numerous examples of crises caused by impermissible residuals. This shall be illustrated using concrete examples from the egg, game and poultry industries.

## 1. Introduction

Food safety is paramount in the food chains with raw materials contaminations, improper treatment or storage and incorrect declarations or expiration dates having become a daily occurrence. Almost every German food company, as well as food companies in other countries, experiences at least one so-called food crisis over the course of its activities. These are often triggered by inconspicuous events that are not indicative of a threat initially. However, experience has shown that what seems like harmless negative customer feedback or complaints can give rise to a full-blown crisis. The consequences are often initiated by media warnings, which might in turn lead to product recalls. These are subsequently published by the supervisory authorities in the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed—RASFF  This is associated with high costs and time expenditures for those parties involved. As a result, recalls can even threaten the very existence of the distributing company responsible. Moreover, the distribution of unsafe food is usually associated with significant image loss. At the same time, the question arises when food should be considered hazardous to health following the legal intention of the general administrative regulations of the EU Rapid Alert System. The Article Food Safety and Crisis Management illustrates this using several real practical examples, which the author Caspar von der Crone has overseen as responsible manager over the last years.

**Edible oleogels for the oral delivery of lipid soluble molecules:**
**Composition and structural design considerations**

* Food grade crystalline and polymer oleogelators exist.

* Oleogel mechanical strength can be altered through composition and processing.

* Oleogel matrices can affect the rate of bioactive release.

* Oleogels can provide stability against bioactive recrystallization.

* Ethylcellulose oleogels are polymer-based and could be used for bioactive delivery.

Background: Edible oleogels, oils structured by non-triglyceride networks, can be used for the delivery of lipid-soluble molecules due to their composition, functional properties, and structure. Different oleogelators exist, including small molecules that crystallize to form colloidal or fibrillar networks and hydrophobic polymers that self-assemble under specific processing conditions. Several types of edible
oleogels have been characterized, but only select systems have been used in oral delivery applications.

Scope and approach: This review covers the potential for use of edible oleogels for lipophilic molecular delivery. 

Factors affecting lipolysis relevant to oil gelation will be discussed, as well as the relationship between lipolysis and bioaccessibility. 

The use of lipid-based delivery systems to increase the bioaccessibility of poorly water-soluble molecules is emphasized, and oleogels are introduced as a delivery
material. The review then discusses different methods of oleogelation, and addresses properties of oleogels that may be beneficial for delivery.

Key findings and conclusions: Oleogel structure, mechanical strength, composition, and gelator type are factors that may affect the rate and extent of lipolysis of the material. These in turn affect the delivery of lipid-soluble molecules from the oleogel. 

Crystalline oleogels used in oral delivery formulations have been shown to offer increased bioaccessibility, prevention against bioactive recrystallization, and targeted or delayed bioactive release. In addition, the ability to manipulate oleogel physicochemical properties with gelator type, formulation, and processing parameters is beneficial for tailoring the material functionality. 

Ethylcellulose oleogels are unique food-grade polymer oleogels that could be used for delivery, similar to other crystalline oleogel systems.

PAS96: 2014 is a guide issued by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture Affairs (DEFRA) and the Food Standards Agency to protect and defend the food and beverage industry from deliberate attacks. This guide describes a system called TACCP. 

TACCP; Collaboration with different disciplines due to the different focus, although they have common points with HACCP risk management methodology. No process can fully guarantee that food is not a crime tool / target, but TACCP was developed to minimize this risk. The objectives of this system are to reduce the likelihood of a deliberate attack, to reduce the consequences (impacts) of an attack, to maintain the reputation of the organization, to give confidence to customers, the press and the community that appropriate steps have been taken to protect food, and to show that necessary measures are taken in protected food. For these purposes, the system can identify specific threats to the manufacturer, calculate the probability of an attack, the attacker's purpose, the weaknesses of the process, the capacity of the attack, determine the potential impacts of a successful attack, identify potential impacts, establish control points to deter the attacker, and generate early warning when the attack occurs. aims to provide information and intelligence systems. 

TACCP; With a knowledgeable and reliable team and an authority is a risk management system that enables the transformation of changes into procedures through the assessment of threats, identification of weak points, control of materials, products, procurement, processing, environment, distribution networks and business systems.

TACCP cannot completely prevent claims of contaminated food, but it helps to decide whether the claim is true or not. Such a claim,

if it is conclusive or convincing, it can create a crisis situation. In order to prevent these situations, the organization follows up the operations step by step.

It should be informed. The TACCP process seeks answers to these four questions: Who might want to attack us? How can they do that? Where are we weak? How can we stop them? Any changes that could affect the TACCP system or potentially break security measures should be passed to the TACCP team leader immediately. It must be reported.

While I have a basic recipe in mind, I recognize that there are critical additives and ingredients that need careful consideration to make this product suitable for large-scale production.

One of the essential components I'm interested in learning more about is baking powder. The type and composition of baking powder are crucial to achieving the perfect rise and texture in muffins. I would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on the best type and composition of baking powder to use in an industrial muffin mix.

Another area of interest for me is emulsifiers. Emulsifiers play a significant role in stabilizing the mix and ensuring consistent quality in a large-scale production setting. I'm curious about which emulsifiers are recommended for use in muffin mixes and how they can improve the texture and shelf life of the product.

In addition to these specific questions, I'm open to any information, tips, or suggestions that can help me develop a high-quality and marketable ready-to-use muffin mix. Your expertise and insights will be invaluable in bringing this project to fruition.

**NOVA. The star shines bright**


*NOVA* is the food classification that categorises foods according to the extent and purpose of food processing, rather than in terms of nutrients. In recent decades some attention has been paid to the increasing importance of food processing in global food supplies and dietary patterns, and its role in the pandemics of diet-related non-communicable diseases. But the specific types of processing that modify food attributes and risks of disease – either negatively or positively – have not been precisely defined. 

Food processing has remained a side issue.

Set out here in its adjusted and refined form, *NOVA* (a name, not an acronym) classifies all foods and food products into four clearly distinct and in our view meaningful groups. It specifies which foods belong in which group, and provides precise definitions of the types of processing underlying each group.



*NOVA* is now recognised as a valid tool for nutrition and public health research, policy and action, in reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization. 
We owe thanks to many colleagues throughout the world for support in the work set out here, for responses to our papers and other publications published since 2009, and for discussions during conferences and other meetings at which *NOVA* and its implications have been presented.

#### Abstract

Aflatoxins are toxic carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced predominantly by two fungal species:  *Aspergillus flavus*  and  *Aspergillus parasiticus* . These fungal species are contaminants of foodstuff as well as feeds and are responsible for aflatoxin contamination of these agro products. The toxicity and potency of aflatoxins make them the primary health hazard as well as responsible for losses associated with contaminations of processed foods and feeds. Determination of aflatoxins concentration in food stuff and feeds is thus very important. However, due to their low concentration in foods and feedstuff, analytical methods for detection and quantification of aflatoxins have to be specific, sensitive, and simple to carry out.

Several methods including thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectroscopy, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), and electrochemical immunosensor, among others, have been described for detecting and quantifying aflatoxins in foods. Each of these methods has advantages and limitations in aflatoxins analysis. This review critically examines each of the methods used for detection of aflatoxins in foodstuff, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each method. Finally, a way forward for overcoming such obstacles is suggested.

The most prominent segment in 2019, accounting for the highest share, and is expected to continue this trend throughout the forecast period. Green tea is an aromatic beverage derived from the plant, Camellia sinensis. This beverage is often prized by consumers due to rich micronutrients such as antioxidants, potassium, manganese, magnesium, and calcium. Regular consumption of tea helps reduce cell damage caused due to free radicals as well as lowers cholesterol levels and facilitates healthy weight loss.

2426,1,"HACCP is a system used to identify, protect, measure, evaluate and control hazards to ensure food safety as defined in Codex Alimentarius. It is a tool designed to identify biological, chemical, physical hazards that may arise during farm to fork processing and to minimize risks to public health. An effective HACCP program is achieved through the provision of effective prerequisite programs. The prerequisite programs can be defined as temel the basic conditions and activities necessary to ensure the safe end product through a hygienic environment ”. Pre-requisite programs enable the establishment of the HACCP program, providing the basic conditions for the control or elimination of a potential hazard to food safety, the determination of quality parameters, and the provision of a hygienic environment.

The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) and existing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are designed primarily to ensure that food is produced, processed, packaged and stored under sanitary conditions to prevent post-process contamination to ensure food safety.

The HARPC (Hazard Analysis and Risk-based Preventive Controls) plan has a similar concept and objective, but the approach is different from GMP and HACCP, because HARPC identifies potential risks or threats to food supply and proactively applies appropriate corrective actions to prevent contamination. applies preventive controls.

Although the proposed HARPC complies well with the HACCP plan, it differs from the need for risk-based preventive controls rather than critical control points. Therefore, it is not necessary to establish critical limits under HARPC. However, in order to minimize significant food risks, the validity of preventive controls should be supported by either proven or “tried and true” scientific data or authentic scientific literature.

Any facility that manufactures, processes, packages, distributes, receives, stores or imports food should develop a HARPC plan for compliance with the FSP (Food Safety Modernization Act) HARPC compliance."

CHEMICALS USED IN FOOD PRESERVATION
Chemicals are very important in the preservation of foods. In food spoilage, chemicals are used to reduce or prevent food from being spoilt, and also extend the shelf life of the food. Chemicals or compounds used in preserving food have beneficial effect on human, animals, and plants. Though chemicals can be used in preserving food, they can also be used for disease treatment; these are chemotherapeutic compounds (James.M.Jay, 1998). Some compounds or chemicals that are used in disease treatment   may not be used in preserving food. Some chemicals used in preserving food can be toxic.
 Some chemicals used in preserving food can also be used in disease treatment, this means some chemicals can perform two or more functions e.g. Antibiotics. Some chemicals have the ability to preserve food due to their inhibition of microbes, but when added to some foods, they might not be able to activate them potential. Most compounds are used widely, and are widely known. They are regarded as generally recognized as safe, because they are substance that are natural and are used in preserving food. 
Chemical additives (food preservatives) are added to food to reduce microbial growth to an acceptable level or inhibit their growth, to improve quality of the food and shelf life of food can be increased. Some chemical additives like BHA [butylated hydroxyl anisole] and BHT [butylated hydroxytoluene] might have some unfavorable effect, despite their uses for preserving food. Some of these effects include; asthma, allergy, dermatitis etc. Oils that are essential, extracted from plant are can be used to show their safety and what they are capable of (Andrea Laukova et al., 2017). The by-products derived from processing plants of fruits, which are being recycled properly and used, is a great interest in industries that produce food, drinks or other manufacturing consumable products. The industry interest is due to their ability to be used as source of meal and oil. Essential oil being derived from seed of plant is of great benefit in food industries, they can be used to increase the shelf-life of product of food. These oils extracted from seeds of plants or fruits can perform different functions due to their ability to preserve food, properties of anti-microbes and anti-oxidants. Micro-organisms also produce compounds which can be beneficial as well, bio-active compounds (Chrissanthy.P, Patrizia et al., 2017). Some preservatives, or chemical used in preserving food, can be mixed together. Example of mixture of preservatives is the mixture of sorbic acids and benzoic acids for preserving mayonnaise. There are some area where sorbic acid is more effective than benzoic acid and conversely. Preservatives can be used in treating ingredients of food, which can be in form of solution or with amount of water for microbial growth, e.g. agents of antifoaming, extracts of malt, gelatin (Wedzicha, 2003). Most additives of chemicals are used to slow or kill pathogenic growth or slow down reaction of chemical due to food oxidation.
Food additives include:
Benzoic acid
Sodium and calcium propionate
Sodium benzoate
Sorbic acid
Potassium sulfite etc.
Classes of other additives include; sodium and calcium ascorbate, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxylanisole, vitamin C, sulfur dioxide. Sequestrants are additive compounds, when added to food helps to remove contaminant [metallic ion] from food. Sequestrants examples include; sorbitol, ethylenediamine-tetra-acetic-acid, tartaric acid (Encyclopedia, 2020).
Some chemical preservatives of food which are regarded as generally recognized as safe, organisms they affected and foods being added to are listed in the table below:
Chemical Preservatives
Foods being added to
Affected Organisms

Parabens 
Soft drinks, salad dressings etc.
Molds and Yeast

Caprylic acid
Wraps of cheese
Molds

Sodium nitrite
Curing preparations of meat
Clostridia

Sulfites
Dried fruits, Making of wine etc.
Microorganisms, Insects

Formate of ethyl
Nuts, Dried fruits
Molds and Yeasts

Oxides of ethyl
Nuts etc.
Vermin, Yeasts and Molds

Sodium diacetate
Bread
Molds

(J.M.Jay, 1998).
Another chemical or compounds is ethylene inhibitors/scavengers for preserving vegetables and fruits (Wei,H., Seidi, F et al., 2020). Ethylene speed up ripening process and there must be a way to slow down the process of ripening in order to extend the shelf life of the product. Fruits and vegetables process of germination, ripening and growth is related to the release of ethylene from vegetables and fruits (Dan et al., 2018). 
Ethylene inhibitors can be used to preserve food. Ethylene must be lowered for food to be preserved. The level of ethylene in fruits depend on the level at which the fruits is being exposed to ethylene, fruits maturity state, and fruits nature. When ethylene is in excess, might lead to over ripening, and thus reduce the shelf life of the produce. For preservation after harvest, the application of ethylene scavengers is very critical for ripening to be slow down (Pathak et al., 2017). In the process of ripening after harvest, the key of reducing products loss and food quality maintenance are the control strategies of ethylene (Suppakul et al., 2016). Strategies like control atmospheric storage, lower temperature are used minimize or reduce post-harvest loss and over ripening due ethylene effects. 
Different chemicals are used to increase the shelf life of fruits [e.g. mango], they include:
Releaser of sulfur dioxide [Stoprot]
Adsorber of ethylene [Ethysord]
Oxidizer of ethylene etc.

Ethylene can be:
Exogenous
Endogenous
For ethylene must be thoroughly analyzed for food preservation, most especially with fruits and vegetables.
An example of endogenous ethylene is 1-methylcyclopropene, which by competing with other ethylene for receptors hinder the ethylene hormonal action (Janjarasskul, 2016). 
Some scavenging agents of ethylene that are exogenous [e.g. ozone (O3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4)] can help in ethylene - carbon oxidation, and some have disadvantages.
Other ethylene scavengers include:
Zeolite
ZSM
Carbon etc.
These scavengers above trigger interaction among materials of packaging and scavenging agents.
Impacts, pathway based on ethylene for vegetables and fruits ripening are studied to show the interaction of ethylene in relation to ripening.
Endogenous ethylene synthesis is more complex than exogenous ethylene. Methionine from plants is the first step for the biosynthetic pathway of endogenous ethylene. The last step is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate for ethylene synthesis. Fruits that are fleshy can be non-climacteric and climacteric, depending on the production of ethylene and rate of respiration.
Non-climacteric fruits do not show an apex in respiration and production of ethylene, while fruits that are climacteric show an apex in respiration and production of ethylene (Pitts et al., 2012).
The rate at which ethylene is produced by fruits that are climacteric is more than the non-climacteric ones during period of full ripening. Ethylene (exogenous) is effective at early stages in climacteric fruits, while in non-climacteric fruits, they are effective at both last and early stages due to their reaction with receptors of ethylene.
Ethylene indicating no ability or capacity to catalyze automatically is due to non-essential additional ethylene treatment, which does not guarantee the ethylene production to increase (Yang et al., 2016).
Different vegetables and fruits common classification (Hu et al., 2019) are:
Climacteric Fruits:
Mango
Tomato
Banana
Apples
Pears
Papaya
Plum etc.

Non-climacteric Fruits:
Potato
Celery
Egg plant
Grapes
Cucumber
Orange
Cabbage
Carrot etc.

These common classifications of vegetables and fruits based on ethylene sensitivity include:
Apples, Mango and Banana falls into category of (0.03 - 0.1 μL/L) sensitivity of ethylene.
Orange, Carrot, Papaya, Cabbage are about (0.01 - 0.02 μL/L) sensitivity of ethylene.
Grapes, Citrus, Berries, Eggplant are above 0.2 μL/L ethylene sensitivity (Hu et al., 2019).
The chemicals to be used for preserving food especially fruits and vegetables might depend on some factors, in which ethylene sensitivity is one of them.

Some of the applications of scavengers of ethylene for vegetables and fruits preservation include:

Method of 1-Methylcyclopropene: Foods e.g. fruits applied to this method include:
Apples: the concentration of internal ethylene of fruits can be subdued within some period of days (Watkins et al., 2012).
Tomatoes: the application of this method will make the rate of respiration and the production of ethylene of tomatoes retard and reduce (Guillen et al., 2007).

Other ethylene scavengers are also applied in vegetables and fruits, they include:
Method of Ozone
Method of KMnO4
Apart from scavengers, natamycin can also be used as preservatives. 
Natamycin is applicable in :
Fruit juices
Yoghurts etc.

For fruit juices that are pasteurized and unpasteurized, natamycin as help these juices in preventing molds and yeast growth (Thomas et al., 2001).
As already said, chemicals being used in preserving food have beneficial effects and also have detrimental effects.
Preservatives like benzoates might cause:
Skin rashes
Asthma
Allergies (Sharma, 2015)

Others include nitrites, sorbic acid etc.
Ability to change to agents of carcinogen is another effect of chemical used in preserving food. They are the most effects harmful which lead to cancer.

Functions of adding preservatives (chemical) to food:
For wastage to be reduced and quality enhanced.
For value of nutrition of food be maintained.
To ensure food being stable and safe.
For mold, yeast and even bacteria growth be inhibited or minimized to an acceptable level.
To increase the shelf life of food.

Chemicals are applicable in:
Food Industries
Drinks/Beverages Industries
Pharmaceutical Industries
Agro-chemical Industries
Other manufacturing Industries, companies etc.

Some people are using chemicals in a wrong way. Some chemicals are bleached to perform some functions in some food.
Food like meats are preserve with chemicals to prevent microbes, enhance taste and other properties. Chemicals are also used for curing meat. Sodium nitrate, Sodium chloride etc. are ingredients of curing (Mehendra Pal et al., 2018).
Examples of chemicals [preservatives] used in preserving some food:

Cheese: they are used in preserving cheese in order to extend the shelf life  (Deegan et al., 2006).
Natamisin
Benzoic acid
Sorbic acid etc.

Cakes: 
Benzoates
Sorbates etc.

Conclusion:
Chemicals are used in preserving food, also for treatment of disease etc. and they can be beneficial and detrimental depending on how it used and applied. Type of chemical to be used might depend on the food, food composition, nature of the food and other factors; but some are using it in a wrong way. Chemicals are to be used rightly, when they are applied.

14841,1,"Hello dear food tech community. 

I am looking for a way to contract fill a ready to drink coffee into aluminum cans or plastic bottles or glass bottles. 
My coffee is sweetened with oat syrup and has a sugar content of about 4% and a pH value of 6.0. It should be able to be stored refrigerated for about six months, better still 12 months. 

What are the technological options for bottling such a product? 
Does it have to be UHT heated with subsequent aseptic filling, or are there other options? 

After consultation with some smaller contract bottlers, hot filling with subsequent pasteurization is not microbiologically sufficient, as the spores cannot be controlled and chemical preservation at pH 6.0 is hardly possible. Hot filling with subsequent autoclaving of the containers is allegedly not effective as it is too expensive and the packaging is partially dented and damaged during autoclaving. 

Do any of you have experience of how the ready-to-drink coffees/cappuccinos that can be found in supermarket refrigerated shelves (usually in cans) are technologically filled?

Many thanks and best regards,

What is Food Analysis?

Food analysis require the application of analytical chemistry in order to analyze substance, products, materials in food [which can be a sample] ; like analyzing sugar, alcohol, acid content in coke, wine, beer etc. With the help of food analysis, information on processing, contamination of food, control of food quality, composition of chemicals will be provided. Applications of food analysis in food helps to ensure the food conform to standard law of trade and food.

Why analyzing food?

Food is analyzed to know whether the food is safe to eat or not, reducing the contaminant, microbes to an acceptable level. Apart from safety of the food, the appearance, texture, value of nutrition, in summary to know and check quality of the food is also one of the reasons why food analysis is very important. The physical characteristics and properties of the food are also made known through analyzing the food.

Sample of the food is very important in food analysis. The substance in the sample is analyzed. The moisture content, sugar level, other chemical composition of the sample, ingredients, additives [at level where they will be acceptable], the label of the food [to make sure it is correct] are all checked and analyzed. Sample can be selected randomly or through representing a product of lot.

The application of analysis method can be based on the substance to be analyzed and the nature of the sample of the substance to be analyzed.

In food stuffs, chemicals are analyzed, what is in the food must be analyzed before going out to the market for customers/buyers/human to consume. To be able to know the good and bad food stuffs, food analysis is needed.

Some foodstuffs might be manipulated, and this might be bad for those that consume such food being manipulated. The role of food scientist and technologist is to ensure the bad food are eradicated, and also ensure the food when analyzed, is safe for consumption of human. Food analysis is very important in food industries, manufacturing companies, hospitals etc. The food stuffs being analyzed are consumed, therefore, even the samples to be tested, the instrument used in analyzing and testing is very essential in order to prevent issues relating to health from showing. In any food organization, or where food is produced in order to ensure the food conform to standard cannot do without analyzing the food. For industries that produce or manufacture bad food, will lead to illness, sickness or other issues relating to consuming bad food. Apart from the customer or consumer of such food getting sick, the company will be at loss and will be questioned in food regulation, control organization for disobeying the law of trade and food. Different methods, techniques of food analysis are used in different control of quality, laboratories, food industries etc. As already said, the use or the choice of the method, instrument of analysis may depend on the food to be analyzed, what to be analyzed in the food, and why the food is analyzed.

Forgery of food:

One of the reasons why food is analyzed is the issue of forgery and manipulation of food. Talking about food forgery, food scientist and technologist need food analysis in order to stop forgery and manipulation of food. With food analysis, [Adulteration of food] the issue of adding another substance to food to improve the quality [but in a bad way], which may devalue the food stuffs can be analyzed and checked

Some of the method, instrument used in food analysis include:

 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

 Gas Chromatography

 Spectroscopy of Atomic Absorption

 Thin Layer Chromatography

 Mass spectrometry etc.

Results can be many due to food analysis. Food analysis can be used for many purposes; to ensure the food stuffs are in ratios that are correct, to remove an inference in food, or for detecting, analyzing allergens in food.

Food analysis is very important to analyze ash, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, mineral, moisture content present in the food. With these, industries will be able to conform to regulations of food that are external. The same thing applicable to beverages; beer, wine, juice where by the acid, sugar and alcohol content are analyzed, checked and make sure that they are in right proportion. One aspect of forgery of food is in the aspect of honey, where by substance like syrups of sugar being added and this can devalue and lower the product quality. With the application of method of food analysis that are advanced in area where food export and import are be done, these will prevent import and export of forgeries.

Importance of some food analysis:

 Analysis of Carbohydrate:

• It is important for parameters of process to be controlled

• For making sure the products and ingredients of food adulteration are detected, the same thing may be applicable to other food analysis

• For determining what the food contains

• To be able to control flow of process

• To ensure and maintain consistency of the product

• To meet the consumer needs


 Analysis of Fat:

• For consistency and flow of the product to be maintained and ensured

• To make sure the product conforms to the requirements of manufacturing.

• To determine whether the fat product conforms to standard or not.

• To ensure the fat content, and the labeling of the product are correct


 Analysis of moisture: analyzing the moisture content is very important in preservation, to reduce contaminants, prevent deterioration and to know the amount of water present.

Recommendations and Regulations of Government:

They deals with ensuring that the food is safe conform to standard; maintain the supply of food quality. The industries must not go against them.

Examples of the government agencies, department for food recommendation, control and regulation include:

 United States Department of Agriculture [USDA]

 Food and Drug Administration [FDA]

 National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control [NAFDAC]

 Standards Organization of Nigeria [SON] etc.

These agencies may be based on standard that are optional and involuntary for food quality, composition, labeling, inspection etc.

 Involuntary standards are:

o Quality standards: including color, appearance, texture of the food etc.

o A standard for the fullness of a food container

 Optional or voluntary standards: e.g. Grading standard etc.

Food analysis is also important for product authenticity and labeling base on nutrition

FOOD SAFETY

Before food can be safe to eat, it must be analyzed. The manufacturers must make sure the microbes are reduced, or removal of harmful substance is done in manufacturing produce, before consuming food. Manufacturing practice must be good, the techniques, method of analysis used for detecting substance that is harmful must also be provided.

In quality control, most manufacturers want to produce quality product to ensure consistency of the product. Food analysis, development and research can help to control the quality problems, variation factors etc.

Food analysis is important in properties of food being monitored, when food is being processed, raw materials and final product being characterized.

Different food characteristics being analyzed include:

a. Structure: these can be examined and analyzed based on level of; structure of macro scope, structure of microscope and structure of molecule

b. Chemical and physical food properties: these include; the changes, shape of food, food process flow, properties that are optical, food stability, food flavor etc.

c. Attributes of sensory: food product being desired due to smelling, tasting of the product.

BOOKS OF FOOD ANALYSIS:

Various books of food analysis are consulted for guidelines on analyzing food. It is a reference for most industries, food scientist, and technologist for food analysis.

Techniques, methods selection for analyzing food: requirements for selecting techniques, methods include:

Accuracy

Speed

Cost

Reproduce ability

Safety

Others include sensitivity, being approved officially etc.

Conclusion:

Food analysis is not just applicable to one area but many areas or aspects. The main area or aspect to note is that; the product and its contents are examined, conform to standards that are regulatory and internal. All the aspect of food analysis is very important and they played a great role in beverages, food manufacturing industries and companies, even in food science and technology generally."

The reasons for the orientation towards cocoa butter replacements are as follows:

1- The production cost of cocoa butter is high and therefore expensive.

2-Because it is a natural substance, there are always changes in the quality of cocoa butter.

3- Tempering is always needed.

4-Chocolates used only cocoa butter have limited stability.

5- Melting properties of cocoa butter are not suitable for all applications and all types of climate.

**Classification** **of** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Substitutes**

Cocoa butter substitutes according to their content and properties; cocoa butter equivalents (Cocoa Butter Equivalents, CBEs), cocoa butter replacers (Cocoa Butter Replacers, CBRs) and cocoa butter substitutes (Cocoa Butter Substitutes, CBSs).

**Cocoa** **Butter** **Equivalents** **(** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Equivalents** **,** **CBEs** **)**

- Cocoa butter equivalents (CBEs) are identical in terms of physical and chemical properties to those of cocoa butter. They differ from cocoa butter in their aroma properties and are produced from raw materials other than cocoa beans. They are also called non-lauric vegetable oils because they do not contain lauric acid. Some of these oils are obtained by modification methods such as hydrogenation, interesterification and fractionation of vegetable oils.

There are some advantages of using CBEs in chocolates:

    1. CBEs are cheaper than cocoa butter and produce more economical chocolate.

    2. Increases the product's tolerance to milk fat.

    3. Increases resistance to storage conditions at high temperatures.

    4. Supports control of oil flowering

**Cocoa** **Butter** **Supports** **(** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Extenders** **,** **CBEXs** **):**

- Cocoa butter supplements consist of components similar to cocoa butter equivalents, but do not mix with cocoa butter at any rate. In the formulation of cocoa butter, a high proportion of palm medium fraction is used.

**Cocoa** **Butter** **Developers** **(** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Improvers** **,** **CBIs** **):**

- They have similar properties to cocoa butter equivalents, but the amount of solid triglycerides they contain is higher than cocoa butter equivalents. Therefore, they are used in the development of soft cocoa butter.

**Cocoa** **Butter** **Substitutes** **(** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Substitutes** **,** **CBSs** **):**

Cocoa butter analogues are lauric based oils that are completely different from cocoa butter in chemical properties but show some similarities to the cocoa butter physically. It is usually derived from palm kernel and coconut oil. Lauric oils contain on average 40-50% lauric fatty acids (C12) and have low molecular weights. Therefore, lauric CBSs are resistant to oxidative rash. The fatty acid chains of such oils are short. TG compositions are completely different from cocoa butter. Therefore, it can be said that there is a significant mismatch between cocoa butter and GISs. Such oils are produced by hydrogenation, interesterification and fractionation techniques. Using these techniques, the fat shows a wider melting range and the amount of fat increases. Using these methods, products similar to cocoa butter in hardness, mouth feel and aroma can be obtained. They are used as coating material by mixing with low fat content or completely defaced cocoa powder.

**Cocoa** **Butter** **Substitutes** **(** **Cocoa** **Butter** **Replacers** **,** **CBRs** **):**

Cocoa butter equivalents are non-lauric based fats whose TG compositions are completely different from cocoa butter, but are similar to cocoa butter in fatty acid composition. Only small amounts can be mixed with cocoa butter. In the literature, the term cocoa butter analogues (CBSs) are sometimes used instead of cocoa butter substitutes (CBRs). These oils are obtained as a result of hydrogenation and fractionation of oils such as soy, cottonseed, peanut, sunflower and corn oil. That is, these oils are special fractions of hydrogenated vegetable oils. The hydrogenation of these oils is carried out in a controlled manner with trans acids which increase the solid phase amount of the oil.

917,1,"Listeria monocytogenes (listeria) is a bacterium that causes an illness called listeriosis. Cases of foodborne illness from listeria are rare, but can involve serious symptoms and even death in certain groups of people. These include:

* people with weakened immune systems, such as those suffering from cancer
* pregnant women and their unborn babies
* newborn babies
* elderly people

## The types of food listeria can be found in

Listeria is widespread in the environment and can contaminate a wide range of foods. It is of most concern in chilled ready-to-eat foods that do not require further cooking or reheating, such as:

* cooked sliced meats
* cured meats
* smoked fish
* cooked shellfish
* blue veined and mould-ripened soft cheeses
* pate
* pre-prepared sandwiches and salads

## What you can do to avoid listeria

To reduce the risk of listeria when preparing food at home, it’s important to:

* keep raw and ready-to-eat foods separate to avoid cross-contamination
* wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly
* keep chilled ready-to-eat foods cold – make sure your fridge is working properly and is set to 5⁰C or below
* always use foods by their use-by date
* follow the storage instructions on the label and use opened foods within two days unless instructions on the packaging say otherwise
* ready-to-eat food must be eaten within four hours of being taken out of the fridge
* cook or reheat foods until they are piping hot right through
* ensure that you follow manufacturer’s instructions in the preparation of all foods

### FSA EXPLAINS

## Foodborne bacteria

Foodborne bacteria live in the gut of many farm animals. During rearing, slaughter and processing it can be transferred into:

* meat
* eggs
* poultry
* milk

Other foods like green vegetables, fruit and shellfish can become contaminated through contact with animal and human faeces. For example, from manure used to improve soil fertility or sewage in water.

Foodborne bacteria can be spread by cross-contamination. For example, if raw and cooked foods are stored together, bacteria can spread from the raw food to the cooked food.

Some foodborne bacteria can also be spread from pets to people and from person to person through poor hygiene. This includes things like failing to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet or after handling pets.

243,1,"#### Abstract

The food additive named polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and identified with the code E-476 (PGPR) is used as emulsifier in tin-greasing emulsions for the baking trade and for the production of low-fat spreads. However, the main application of PGPR is in the chocolate industry, where, besides its action as an emulsifier, it also has important properties as a viscosity modifier and thus improves the moulding properties of the molten chocolate. An additional property of PGPR in chocolate is its ability to limit fat bloom. Known chemical methods for preparing this emulsifier involve long reaction times and high operating temperatures, which adversely affect the quality of the final product leading to problems of coloration and odors that could make it inadvisable for the food industry. As an alternative, the enzymatic synthesis of PGPR by the catalytic action of two lipases has been developed. The enzymes act in mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure, neutral pH, and in a solvent-free system, which makes the process environmentally friendly and avoids side reaction, so that the product has a higher purity and quality.

#### 1. Food Additives

Food additives have been developed over the years to meet the needs of food production, as making foods on a large scale is a very different task to making them in the kitchen at home. Additives are needed to ensure processed food remains in a good condition throughout its journey from the factory to the shop and to the consumer at home. Some are so essential that they are even used in organic foods [[1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B1)–[3](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B3)].

In the broadest of terms, food additives are substances intentionally added to food either directly or indirectly with one or more of the following purposes [[4](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B4)]:(1)to maintain or improve nutritional quality;(2)to maintain product quality and freshness;(3)to aid in the processing or preparation of food;(4)to make food more appealing.

On the other hand, food additives may only be authorized if [[4](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B4)](1)there is a technological need for their use;(2)they do not mislead the consumer;(3)they present no hazard to the health of the consumer.

The use of food additives must always be labelled on the packaging of food products by their category (antioxidant, preservative, colour, etc.) with either their name or E number. In the United States, food additives are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Two sections of the regulations govern their use: substances affirmed as GRAS, that is, Generally Recognized as Safe, (21CFR184) and Direct Food Additives (21CFR172). Substances that have been affirmed as GRAS usually have less stringent regulations attached to their use. However, Food and Drug Administration Standards of Identity may preclude their use in certain standardized foods. In comparison, Direct Food Additives may be allowed only in certain specific foods at low maximum allowable levels. The method of manufacture and analytical constants may also be defined.

The European Community (EC) regulates food emulsifiers in an analogous fashion to United States regulations, identifying the additives with E numbers. Specific regulations, however, must be consulted before food products are designed for international markets. For example, polyglycerol esters up to a degree of polymerization of 10 are widely accepted in the United States. For the EC, this value may not exceed 4. Standards of Identity may also differ significantly. Other countries, which have not formed trading communities, may have regulations, which are unique [[5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B5)–[7](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B7)].

The food additive functional classes are based on the Codex Class Names and the International Numbering System (INS) for Food Additives (CAC/GL 36-1989). There are four general categories of food additives: nutritional additives, processing agents, preservatives, and sensory agents. These are not strict classifications, as many additives fall into more than one category [[8](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/124767/#B8)].(1) *Nutritional additives.*  They are utilized for the purpose of restoring nutrients lost or degraded during production, fortifying or enriching certain foods in order to correct dietary deficiencies or adding nutrients to food substitutes.(2) *Processing agents.*  These additives are added to foods in order to aid in processing or to maintain the desired consistency of the product.(3) *Preservatives.*  They are classified into two main groups: antioxidants (compounds that delay or prevent the deterioration of foods by oxidative mechanisms) and antimicrobials (inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food).(4) *Sensory agents.*  Such as colorants (natural or synthetics), flavorings, and sweeteners.

3839,1,"The demand for natural additives in the food industry is increasing as a response to an increasingly demanding market for the appeal of what is natural, as well as concerns about the health risks that some artificial additives pose.

Several studies indicate that there are potential risks arising from the consumption of artificial dyes, ranging from genotoxic and carcinogenic effects to the development of urticaria, asthma, nausea, eczema, bronchitis, bronchitis, bronchospasm, headache, reduced blood coagulation, hyperactivity and increase of iron and zinc urinary excretion in children, even at concentrations recommended as safe. 

As a result, interest in the substitution of artificial dyes for natural alternatives increases.

Natural dyes can be classified as tetrapyrrolides (chlorophylls), isoprenoids (carotenoids: betacarotene, bixin, astaxanthin, curcumin, among others), benzopyrans (flavonoids and anthocyanins), N-heterocyclic compounds (betalains), quinones (carmine), caramel (which are the result of
processing sugars).

These dyes confer varying coloring depending on their chemical structure and class, covering spectra of yellow, orange, red, purple, green and brown. In addition, other dyes have been studied for their application in foods, such as genipin, which may show staining that varies from blue to black.

Three important classes of natural dyes that can be used in food and present biological activity, but have great limitations with regard to stability are carotenoids, anthocyanins and betalains.

Carotenoids are tetraterpenoid compounds, as they are formed by the union of eight isoprenoid units, having a long chain of conjugated double bonds that form a chromophore system, which gives it the coloring pigment characteristic that varies between yellow, orange and red, present in various foods. 

Various changes in its primary molecular structure, such as cyclization, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, introduction of oxygen-containing groups, rearrangements, chain shortening or combinations of these modifications, result in an immense variety of molecules belonging to this group, so that more than 650 carotenoids were isolated and characterized, disregarding the cis and trans isomers, and about 100 of these have already been identified in foods.

Beta-carotene, alphacarotene and beta-cryptoxanthin are pro-vitamins A, and lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene do not have this activity.
Because they are lipids, carotenoids are essentially hydrophobic. 

Although stable at pH changes, they are sensitive to light and high temperature, especially in the presence of oxygen.

13969,1,"### an intersection between health and tech

Enter: **food technology.** And more specifically, a new wave of snacks that are produced through novel processes that feel just a little bit sci-fi.

Like…

* **Jellyfish crisps.** At the University of Southern Denmark, researchers have created new technology that turns jellyfish into…crisps (that’s *chips* to the Americans among you). It’s a [speculative project](https://echobranddesign.co.uk/work/jellyfish-crisps/), but it adds an exciting twist to the challenge of sustainable snacks – by gamifying the idea of eating an invasive species through dramatic brand storytelling, in which jellyfish are framed as a looming threat to human civilisation.
* **3D printed snacks**. PepsiCo has been using [3D](https://all3dp.com/pepsico-built-a-better-potato-chip/) printers for the research and development of potato chip products since 2011. And the tech has come on leaps and bounds; as of 2023, you can go to a [3D printing restaurant](https://www.3dwasp.com/en/londra-il-primo-ristorante-al-mondo-a-stampare-il-cibo-wasp-stampa-in-3d-piatti-e-bicchieri-in-porcellana/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=GLOBAL-en-SE-DSA-Sito&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=3352968755&hsa_cam=16280182754&hsa_grp=139246202851&hsa_ad=583042531321&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-19959388920&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyqWkBhBMEiwAp2yUFmanTzeUgFN-eAyQT4GzC-ZsNVhISbVWU3i3rMUBT9EhBrL6MBh6HBoCSFgQAvD_BwE) or buy one of many [food printers](https://all3dp.com/1/best-3d-food-printer/) available on the market.
* Dutch innovator Elzelinde van Doleweerd has put a bigger purpose behind 3D food – by **creating snacks printed from** [food waste](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/3d-printed-snacks-210220195/) **products.** A positive sign of the immense possibilities that printing tech holds for sustainable (and delicious) snacks.
* **Salad wafers.** Bridging the divide between delicious, satisfying snacks and genuinely nutritious meals, startup founder Dr. Heather Daniell used her background in **organic chemistry** to create a natural, patent-pending process that turns vegetables into [crispy wafers](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2019/07/30/the-need-and-the-technology-came-together-meet-the-start-up-turning-salads-into-wafers-for-snack-satisfaction) – without needing any sugars or starches as binding agents.

And there’s a growth of **new technologies** that are expected to drive new snack possibilities in the near future. Including ultrasound and microwave-assisted vacuum frying ([USMVF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960308518300099)); pulsed electric field ([PEF](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/fo/c7fo01857f)) pre-processing treatments; and [electrospinning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043452619300208) technology.

Tech is driving a whole new snack revolution.

3. A Clean Manufacturing Space

The space should be devoid of impurities and avoid lollipop contamination.

4. Hygiene And Sanitation

Proper hygiene and sanitation are significant aspects of lollipop creation.To prevent germs and other hazardous microbes from influencing the quality of the finished product.Utensils and equipment must be periodically sanitised. 

5. Ingredient Testing

Another crucial step in creating lollipops is ingredient testing to ensure that only premium ingredients are used. 

6. Routine Maintenance
The machinery that makes these candy lollipops must also undergo routine maintenance to ensure proper operation and continuous, high-quality output. 

7. Packaging And Labelling Regulations

Finally, packaging and labelling regulations must be satisfied to tell consumers about the products they purchase effectively.Manufacturers may make safe, high-quality lollipops that meet consumer expectations, maintain regulatory compliance, and don't skimp on taste or safety by putting all these quality control methods in place.  

Ingredients Used in Lollipop Manufacturing 
1. Sugar

2772,1,"**Food Fraud and Food Defence Threats – Closer to Home Than You Might Think**

by Dr Andreas Klieber, **Quality Associates - Australia**
Ph: 1300 73 71 93  E: info@qualityassociates.com.au Web: [https://www.qualityassociates.com.au/](https://www.qualityassociates.com.au/)

In 2018, Australian food threats became front and centre of mind for the food industry and the public as well. Just mention the word needle today and everyone has a story to tell.

In amongst this major threat, we may not have noticed a few other Australian food fraud issues and threats. For example, fake Australian produced liquor (mainly water, colours, alcohol) was fraudulently marketed and after an ABC investigation this product was eventually recalled. Also, the ACCC conducted a major investigation into potentially fake honey being imported into Australia; this was in the end inconclusive. And we are part of an international supply chain which is seeing ever-increasing issues with food fraud; in Europe, there has been a 30% increase in transnational cooperation request for food fraud investigations.

The Australian government acted in response to these threats, including by expanding the Division 82 sabotage offences in the Criminal Code to include food and services and utilities relating to food as 'public infrastructure'.

Food fraud data shows us the vast amount of national and business income Australia is losing due to lost export opportunities. In 2016/17 this was estimated to amount to $1.5 billion across the fisheries, dairy, horticulture, wine, meat and grains sectors (McLeod, R. 2017. Counting the Cost: Lost Australian food and wine export sales due to fraud. FIAL).

While the costs to companies and consumers from food fraud keep increasing, we cannot forget that food fraud easily spills into food safety issues; just imagine what the consequences from adding allergenic peanut shells into cumin could have been. As it was, in the US more than 700 products had to be recalled due to this issue (Food Safety and Quality, 17 March 2015).

Food companies are moving to deal with these food fraud and defence risks. GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) standards require the implementation of Food Fraud and Food Defence mitigation strategies. But beyond that, leading food manufacturers and retailers are recognising that these measures implicitly reduce overall business failure risk and risks to the bottom line.

To start on this journey of mitigating food fraud and defence risks, through what are termed TACCP (Threat Analysis Critical Control Points) and VACCP (Vulnerability Analysis Critical Control Points) systems, can be overwhelming at first. However, by breaking this process down into specific steps of risk identification, risk assessment and prioritisation these systems can be implemented and managed effectively.

Quality Professionals in the food industry are already exposed to this approach through HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) systems. The key is to recognise that the approach in the TACCP and VACCP systems are not that different in principle. What is different though is that the scope of the TACCP and VACCP systems is much wider. They cover the whole supply chain from source of raw materials, distribution, processing, retailing and to the final consumer.

As an example, the consumer is generally targeted by food fraud and one of the most effective ways of preventing that would be measures that are obvious to the consumer. Much technology and labelling solutions are being developed currently to tip off the consumer to whether they are purchasing a genuine product or not. This includes individual item bar codes, rather than product bar codes, and labels that when inspected by mobile phone apps show up as genuine or not.

Much risk also exists in long raw material supply chains. Approved supplier schemes are meant to deal with this risk, but with an estimated global trade of fraudulent raw materials and foods amounting to $50 billion a year, vigilance is essential. Trusted relationships, cemented through long-term cooperation, understanding of supplier food fraud and defence controls and a site review program are the best ways to minimise these risks. There is no better substitute to going and having a look if it is not clear what risks a supplier poses.

In the final analysis then, Australian food manufacturers and exporters stand to gain much from implementing food fraud and food defence threat countermeasures. This ranges from protecting their consumers and their businesses from due diligence and personal liability point of view to ensuring that food businesses do not fail due to financial burdens of serious scandals. As such, implementation and maintenance of these systems should be driven by the C-suite managers as are other financial and business risks.

Carnitine is an amino acid that studies to soothe the feeling of hunger and fat burning. There are 4 types of arnitine: D-Carnitine, Acetyl L-Carnitine, Propionyl L-Carnitine, L-Carnitine L-Tartrate. Depending on the rate of absorption in the body, the type of carnitine used in food supplements is l-carnitine l-tartrate. L-carnitine (β-hydroxy-γ-trimethylammonium butyrate) is an amino acid synthesized by the body. Lysine-methionine and cofactors (C, B3, B6 and Iron), the two leading amino acids, can be synthesized by the body when they are present in sufficient quantities. The lack of any of these nutrients may limit the body's ability to produce 1-carnitine.

Its main metabolic function is to bring long-chain fatty acids into the matrix part of the mitochondria so that fat stores can be used as energy sources. In this way, the transport process is realized to convert the fat stored in the body into energy.

As a result of the researches conducted in 2015 and 2016, hypotheses that l-carnitine provides an increase in performance become reality. This is mainly due to its positive impact on fat burning and oxygen utilization capacity. They also found that 1-carnitine supplementation was effective in reducing the production of free radicals, tissue damage, and muscle pain after training.

Although unaware, l-carnitine is part of our diet. Most foods are present in different proportions and are consumed continuously throughout the day. Red meat (eg lamb, venison and beef) is rich in 1-carnitine. Fish, poultry, milk and breast milk contain smaller amounts of l-carnitine, while plant nutrients contain negligible amounts of l-carnitine. The vegetarian diet is very poor in terms of the leading components that produce both l-carnitine and l-carnitine. The research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that vegetarian individuals contain lower levels of l-carnitine in their blood. For this reason, carnitine is suitable for vegetarian use.

Some of the benefits of carnitine are as follows: Suppressing the feeling of hunger in the food helps people consume less food. It is the necessary compound for the body to burn fat. It improves training performance due to its effect on metabolism. Slows down bone density. Using it under the supervision of a doctor during pregnancy can have positive health consequences.

In addition, no damage was found in the researches. The European Food Safety Authority concluded that it is safe to take L-carnitine food supplements up to 2 grams per day. For people who want to support fat burning with sports, it is recommended to use in combination with regular sports or intense physical activity to help the body's nutrients and stored fats convert into energy."

Today we are announcing a new third-party food safety standards alignment pilot program that is designed to help both the FDA and industry better understand how to determine whether these standards align with FDA regulations to help ensure safer food for consumers – a goal that is consistent with and an important element of our New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint

The FDA understands how determinations that third-party audit standards align with the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) regulations could provide importers and receiving facilities with confidence that the standards used to audit their suppliers adequately consider the FDA’s food safety requirements. In addition, alignment determinations could help the FDA’s investigators more efficiently determine whether importers and receiving facilities are in compliance with FSMA supplier verification requirements""

**Additional Information**

* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is launching a voluntary pilot program to evaluate alignment of private third-party food safety audit standards with the food safety regulatory requirements in two regulations under FSMA, the Preventive Controls for Human Food (PC Human Food) and the Produce Safety rules.

* The FDA is aware that many throughout the food industry voluntarily rely on private audit standards to evaluate their suppliers’ performance. In addition, the FDA also understands that determinations that third-party audit standards align with FSMA regulations could provide importers and receiving facilities with confidence that these audits could also be used to fulfill certain FSMA supplier verification requirements.

Did you know that by spraying good bacteria in really large numbers on the surface of food, they can out-compete the bad bacteria, which means the bad bacteria can’t grow? That way, these cultures can help keep food fresh and safe for longer, helping to reduce food waste as well.

“Food waste in Australia costs the economy around 20 billion Australian dollars a year. That equates to around one in five bags of groceries that gets thrown in the rubbish bin, which makes it a significant and important matter for the Australian food industry to address. Adding those few crucial days can save food manufacturers also huge amounts of money in the distribution chain,” says [Kylie Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAYn7aEBxsmVKrolYp26Eg1Itkb_w8tlzr8), country manager Australia & New Zealand.

Want to learn more about how our cultures with bioprotective effect can contribute to the fight against food waste, also in Australia? Watch this video, which has just been presented at the Australian Food and Grocery Council’s 2021 Symposium.

It appears that the industry standard is to use very thick (5-7 mils) Mylar, which has extremely low oxygen & moisture vapor transmission rates. Coupled with an appropriately sized desiccant & oxygen absorber, this will handle any oxygen or humidity that is present in the bag once sealed. 

My question, though, is; Can a thinner bag with higher oxygen & moisture vapor transmission rates achieve the same shelf-life if compensated with higher capacity desiccants & oxygen absorbers, and/or gas-flush sealing? 

If so, how would one go about calculating this?"

2463,1,"**WHAT IS GLUTEN?**

The definition of gluten made by the Codex according to the special dietary standard for the use of people with gluten intolerance is 'a fraction of protein insoluble in water and 0.5 M NaCl found in wheat, rye, barley, oats or hybrid varieties and derivatives thereof, which some people cannot tolerate'. It shaped.

**WHAT IS GLUTEN FREE FOOD?**

Gluten-free food According to the Codex standard for special dietary foods for the use of people with gluten intolerance;
a) Wheat (for example, all Triticum species, durum wheat, gum and camouflage), rye, barley, oats or hybrid varieties of these or one or more components containing one or more of them, gluten amount does not exceed 20 mg / kg consumer food sold or distributed,

b) Wheat (for example all Triticum species, durum wheat, gum and camouflage), rye, barley, oats or hybrid varieties containing one or more components, gluten removed by special processes, gluten level 20 mg / kg not defined.

Specially treated foods with reduced gluten content to 20-100 mg / kg;

The gluten content of one or more components containing wheat (for example, all Triticum species, durum wheat, gum and camouflage), rye, barley, oats or hybrid varieties thereof, is reduced to a specific consumer reduced gluten content by 20-100 mg / kg. food is sold or distributed.

According to the Turkish Food Codex Communiqué on Foods Suitable for Individuals with Gluten Intolerance, the term kullan gluten-free ve and “very low gluten” can be used provided that the gluten level in the food to be presented to the last consumer does not exceed 20 mg / kg and that it does not exceed 100 mg / kg.

**EFFECTS OF GLUTEN ON DOUGH:**

The biscuit has three main components; wheat flour, oil and sugar. Flours having a gluten content of 7.5-12% in quantity are used for various biscuits. The quantity and quality of the protein contained in the flour are the most important factors affecting the flour quality. Among proteins, gluten proteins (glutenin and gliadin) have a very important place. Glutenin and gliadin proteins are hydrated during the kneading of the dough and combine with various chemical bonds to form gluten in the elastic and plastic structure, which significantly affects the properties of the dough and forms a semi-continuous phase within the dough. Gluten forms the skeleton of the dough, keeping the air added to the dough during the kneading process and the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas generated by the yeasts within the dough, making the bread swell and having a porous structure.

![image|315x212](upload://hwLcjDH3sBOBElVwQQEQYCWki0D.png) 

Gluten increases the water holding capacity of the flour and stabilizes its structure by giving water (dehydrated) when heated to about 85 0C. In the kneaded bread dough, insoluble but highly water-absorbing (hydrated) gluten forms a semi-continuous phase within the dough by surrounding other elements of the dispersed phase, such as starch particles and air bubbles.

![image|259x194](upload://1doZa8Toy3FklfHWTqRBxrmJdyt.png) 


**GLUTEN-FREE BISCUIT INGREDIENTS AND ADDITIVES;**

• Starch (corn, potato)

• Vegetable oil (palm, soy, cotton, sunflower)

• Candy

• Glucose-Fructose syrup

• Porkatal husk puree 0.9% (glucose syrup, orange husk, orange husk oil, acidity regulator (citric acid), pectin, tocopherol)

• Salt

• Natural orange flavoring

• Bleach (ammonium carbonate)

• Emulsifiers (mono and diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono and diglycerides of fatty acids, sunflower lecithin)

**Starch:**

Starch is mainly formed by polymerization of α-D-glucose units. Chemically, there are two types of polymers; amylose, a linear polymer; and amylopectin, a branched polymer. In cereal starches, amylose is present in approximately 23% and amylopectin in 77%. Cereal starches contain very low amounts of fat. The starch composition also contains phosphorus and nitrogen.

![image|690x433](upload://sEmrtLaIehUQSW00tgr8q6raKRo.jpeg) 


The changes of starch during heating in the presence of water determine the properties of many foods. Starch is insoluble in water but swells by absorbing water when stored in a high relative humidity or contact with water. The ends in which starch absorbs water are polysaccharide hydroxyl groups. In this case, hydrogen bonds form between the water molecules and the hydroxyl groups. Starch can hold up to 30% of its dry weight in water. The swelling of the granule results in an increase of 5% in volume.
         In gluten-free formulations, the dough has a more fluid structure than wheat flour doughs due to lack of gluten network. Increased viscosity in starchy formulations is due to starch uptake and swelling of water.
         Starch is often found in gluten-free biscuit products as a combination of starch. For example; corn, soy, millet, rice, potato starches are mixed in certain proportions. Gums can also be used with starch."

Honey is a natural source of food with countless health benefits. This study was to investigate the quality of honey from well-known honey extraction modes in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. 24 honey samples were taken from bee farms in two districts in the region and subjected to physicochemical and microbiology analysis. Moisture content of the honeys, their pH, water insoluble solids, and sugar were determined.

ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 16140-1: 2016 methods of microbial assays were done to determine the presence of aerobes, coliforms, E.coli and fungi. Statistical analysis was carried out using the GraphPad Prism 5. The results indicated that moisture content of the honeys ranged from 14.46%-22.31%. The pH values were within the acidity range (4.1-4.3), whiles water insoluble solids ranged from 0.56% to 8.50%; sucrose level ranged from 2.64%-3.12%, but the pressed honey had the highest glucose+fructose (90%). There was significant differences (p<0.05) in the microbial quality of the honeys from the two districts, and under the different treatments. Cold extracted honeys recorded the highest bacterial count of 4.614 × 103 cfu/g, honey from pressed method had the least count of 3.30 × 102 cfu/g. Food pathogens were not detected. Aerobes were within safe limits; hence, these honeys were classified as safe for consumption. The results indicated that the best mode of honey extraction was by honey press. All the detected counts fell within the acceptable limits. The study concluded that generally, honey produced locally is safe for consumption.

Labne is a fermented dairy product. This product is made by standardization of fat and dry matter and using yoghurt culture. It has a slightly acidic flavor. Its color is milky white and its structure is soft, smooth and creamy. Labne is mainly consumed in Lebanon, Syria, Morocco and Iraq and Middle East countries.

Labne has a longer shelf life than yoghurt and is widely consumed. It is generally consumed by spreading on bread and adding olive oil. In one study, 25 different dry matter, 9.08% protein, 11.87% fat, 0.63% ash and 4.23 pH values ​​were determined in labne production using two different methods. In the labne samples produced by ultrafiltration method, they determined between 22.65-23.95% dry matter, 7.80-8.31% protein, 10.59-11.33% fat, 0.67-0.70% ash and 4.17- 4.23 pH values.

Main methods used in industry; to make standardization of dry matter by centrifugation after fermentation in mechanical separation method, using milk powder in reconstitution method and pressure and temperature application in ultrafiltration method. In a study, the traditional method, before and after fermentation ultrafiltration, before and after fermentation obtained by the reverse osmosis methods consistency and microstructures of labne samples examined as a result of the traditional way produced 23.31% dry substance, 9.18% fat, 9.20% protein, 4.16% fat lactose and ash was reported to be 0.79%. 

The choice of starter culture is important to produce quality labne. Different starter cultures are used. The most effective mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus. When used as a mixture of coagulation time, it was found to be more effective than using one by one. In a study, labne produced using probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus culture instead of yoghurt culture as a culture has been turned into a healthier product thanks to probiotic microorganism and it has been found that it does not bring additional cost to production."

The BRC manual should be updated and article 1.1.6 should be evaluated. In this item, define systems where employees can report concerns about product safety, integrity, quality, and regulatory compliance.

Since counterfeiting is one of the most emphasized statements, a table should be created that includes the measures taken against counterfeiting. The risks of counterfeiting in raw materials should be evaluated and their measures defined.

One of the new requirements of version 8 is the food safety culture plan. The food safety culture plan should start from purchasing and include production, quality control, maintenance, storage, shipment, customs, human resources, sales and marketing. In the plan, aim, aim-oriented method, measurement method and measurement frequency should be defined. When creating the plan, when talking about the existing systems in the enterprise, the missing parties should also be evaluated and the things that should be done should be identified and a responsible should be assigned and the target date should be given. Thus, the path will be followed in line with the goal of continuous improvement.

1241,1,"In today's economic and social conditions, factors such as increasing the number of people working outside the home, changing dietary habits, and less time to prepare meals lead people to ready-to-use or more practical food consumption.

In this sense, increasing the durability of the food, which can be defined as shelf life, preserving its freshness, nutritional value, appearance, color, smell and aroma becomes an expected feature of that food. Therefore, the use of additives, which are one of the methods of food preservation and enrichment, has become technologically obligatory. The use of food additives is very high. The main ones are as follows.

• To maintain the nutritional value of food,

• For the production of special food for people with specific dietary needs,

• To increase food durability and have a longer shelf life,

• To improve the textural properties of food.

• To make the taste and color of food attractive or preserved.

• To prevent unwanted reactions such as oil rancidity (oxidation), to prevent loss of flavor and to protect nutrients.

• Mostly as technological requirement during food processing,

• To prevent the growth of disease-causing microorganisms in food.

• They are used to provide food variety.

Besides the above reasons, there are many more reasons. In particular, food additives become compulsory to be used in today's technological and social conditions. The dosage of additives is important. Proper food additives show an effective result when used in the right proportions.

1346,1,"While thermal processes such as pasteurization and sterilization are commonly used for the inactivation of microorganisms during the production of milk and dairy products, alternative methods have been needed due to nutrient and aroma losses caused by heat treatment, non-enzymatic browning and sensory changes in the products. Non-thermal high pressure (HP), pulsed light (PL), ultraviolet irradiation (UV), supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and pulsed electric field (PEF) methods are used to extend the shelf life of milk.

![milk_shelf_life|690x460](upload://vMnHcZJvfvhgqPcdazdoJnD8lJo.jpeg) 


**High** **Pressure** **Method**

This method generally involves the application of pressure between 100 MPa and 1000 MPa, in particular between 100 MPa and 600 MPa, the principle of which is based on the principle of compressing the water surrounding the material. The HP method does not adversely affect the taste of the products and acts to stop the activity of microorganisms. It leads to changes in the physical appearance and texture of the food, while prolonging the shelf life of the food and inactivating the disrupting microorganisms after the application of pressure in the food. Pathogen microorganisms have been reported to affect cell / cell membrane leading to cell death. During application, factors such as pressure, time and temperature can damage microorganisms.

**Pulsed** **Light**

PL application is a non-thermal sterilization method with radiation light which provides antimicrobial effect without damaging the content and surface of the product used. In this method, broad spectrum wavelengths (200–1000 nm) in the UV region close to the infrared region are used. A surface to be sterilized is exposed to at least 1 pulse of light with an energy density of approximately 0.01–50 J / cm2, in which case a wavelength distribution of 170–2600 nm should be used. The duration of the pulses ranges from 1 μs to 0.1 s, with a flash of 1–20 per second. It shows antimicrobial effect on disrupting microorganisms in foods.

**Ultraviolet** **Irradiation**

UV forms a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum within the range of 100–400 nm. UV-C; It has a lethal effect against microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, yeast, mold and algae. In order to achieve microbial inactivation, food must be exposed to an energy of at least 0.04 J / cm2. UV light causes mutations and cell death by causing cross-linking between thymine and cytosines in the same DNA sequence. Factors such as species, strain, culture determine the degree of UV exposure of microorganisms. The type and structure of food are also effective. UV method has a lethal effect on microorganisms in 3 ways as liquid sterilization, air disinfection and inhibition of microorganism on the surface.

**Super** **Critical** **Carbon** **Dioxide**

If the gases are heated above their critical temperature and pressure is applied, they pass to a fourth phase called supercritical phase. The SC-CO2 method is a method known as the green method, using a critical temperature of 31.1 ° C and a critical pressure of 7.38 MPa. SC-CO2 method; It is an effective method which ensures the preservation of food quality with minimum loss from traditional thermal application methods.

**Pulsed** **Electric** **Field**

I hope all is well. I am Ashik working as a food technologist in Food Industry.

First of all, I would like to appreciate your contributions to the FST desk. I have seen your post in fst desk regarding the vegetable jelly crystal formulation. I have formulated jelly crystals from kappa-carrageenan with citric acid (trisodium citrate, sugar, flavour and colour). But it forms Cake a few days after packaging.

After mixing, it takes moisture from the atmosphere and becomes moist, and after packing, it loses the absorbed moisture and solidifies.

When I reviewed research articles => what I understood that the relative humidity at which a powder undergoes deliquescence is lowered when two deliquescent solid is present in the mixture

https://doi.org/10.1080/10837450600939057

According to the Study

The fructose and citric acid mixture started deliquescing at a significantly lower RH (around 48%RH)

Than either fructose (RH0 = 62% RH) or

Citric acid alone (RH0 = 75% RH).

Due to this, I have replaced the citric acid with tartaric acid, but the same process happened. Also, I have tried anti-caking agents (silicon dioxide) that also failed.

It would be helpful I could suggest any change in formulation or in the process to prevent the caking problem

**Formula:**

Sugar--88.96%

Carrageenan---3.64%

Citric Acid---3.03%

Potassium Citrate---2.59%

Salt---0.51%

Strawberry Flavor ---- 0.16%

Black Carrot extract---1.08%

Curcumin----0.03%

6580,1,"The major difference in drinking raw unprocessed and pasteurized milk is in its bacterial count. In the subtropical and developing countries where milking is still a small scale hand-operated task, in the marginal area of farms, the initial bacterial count of raw milk reaches up to 2-3 lacks bacteria/ml. Even though we are boiling milk in the kitchen, the cooling happens at a natural slow speed. In this time the spores (eggs or dormant bacterial cells) again germinate between 55-65°C temperature range. In industrial pasteurization, however, the milk is RAPIDLY COOLED to below 5°C before spores are germinated. this brings down the bacterial population to below 20,000/ml in pasteurized milk and practically ZERO in UHT sterilized milk. 

FSSAI has made regulatory standards for all food products that allow maximum of 20k bacterial cells in milk samples. If any 2 or more samples out of 5 are found above 20k, or even 1 out of 5 is above 50k, the entire batch is compulsorily reprocessed before it reaches the shelf. COURSE, WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THIS EFFECT IN OUR KITCHEN making it safest to drink only pasteurized/ heat-treated milk.

Inulin belongs to the class of carbohydrates and is known as fructants. Oligofructose is obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of inulin. Inulin is used in the food industry because of its functional properties, low calorie value, dietary fiber and prebiotic effects. Stimulates the development of bifidobacteria in the intestines. In addition, it reduces the risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

Industrially, inulin is produced from chicory and is found in the roots and tubers of plants such as inulin, dahlias, asparagus, onions, artichokes, dandelions and locusts (Crow, 2005).

Inulin is colorless and odorless. Slightly sweet when dissolved in water. Depending on the degree of polymerization (DP) it is classified as both soluble and insoluble fiber. Most plants, especially dicotyledons, are carbohydrate stores. In the food industry, chicory (Cichorium intybus) and ground diamond (Helianthus tuberosus) are widely used, but are also available in garlic, asparagus, onions, leeks and bananas (Rocha et al., 2006).

Inulin replaces starch alone as a replacement polysaccharide in the roots and tubers of said plants, or in some plants with starch, and between 40 and 45 percent inulin are reported in the endive roots and locus. It is a white, tasteless, odorless powder that is reported to be gelatinised when heated in water, which is colloidally soluble inulin. It is reported that inulin, which is insoluble in alcohol and ether, dyed yellow with iodine, has a low reducing power, is resistant to alkalis such as starch and glycogen, can be hydrolyzed to D-fructose with various acids and is resistant to amylase enzyme (Kelly, 2008).

Inulin is used as a fat substitute in dairy products due to its interaction with whey protein and casein. Long chain and high molecular weight inulin are more preferred as oil substitutes. The chain length reduces solubility and makes the inulin mixed with water and milk take the form of microcrystals, creating a creamy feeling in the mouth.

Today, as a result of the indirect effects of human nutrition and health, it has started to be used as an ingredient in many industries (confectionery industry, chocolate industry, lacquer industry, cheese industry (especially in low fat cheese production) and salad dressing industry).

2511,1,"Bread is formed by mixing, kneading and baking flour, water, yeast and salt as the main ingredients. The source of flour, which is one of the basic components of bread, is wheat. There are different wheats according to usage type. For example; Triticum aestivum vulgare has gluten quality suitable for fermented bread making. Triticum durum, durum wheats, gluten quality is low. Triticum durum compactum is the wheat used in bread making with high gluten quality.

Wheat quality is determined by many variables: physical properties of the grain, starch content, and protein content and structure. Among the quality characteristics, the protein storage property of the seed is the most important for bread quality (Dowell et al., 2008).

According to the Turkish Food Codex Communiqué on Wheat Flour;

- Wheat flour does not contain foreign taste and odor.

- There is no flammable substance in the flour.

- Wheat flour has its own color and appearance.

The whole wheat grain contains about 12% water, 71.2% carbohydrate, 11% protein, 1.7% fat, 2.2% cellulose and 1.9% mineral. Wheat with a protein content of more than 13% is rich in glutence and wheat with protein content of less than 11% is called glutence poor (Vural N., 1992).

Since α-amylase enzyme content is insufficient in wheat in our country, α-amylase addition is used in bread making. α-amylase converts starch to sugar, thus reducing the fermentation time of the dough. This sugar from starch is used by yeast and carbon dioxide gas is released. Carbon dioxide gas expands with the temperature in the dough supplied to the oven for baking and contributes to the bread making of bread with smooth internal structure, more volume and easily digestible quality. Another additive to the good volume of bread is vitamin C. Vitamin C increases the quality of the proteins in the flour and contributes to the quality of bread production and also increases the nutritional value of bread. Adulterations in bread making:

- Bleaching of raw flour,

- Addition of undesirable additives (cysteine, DATEM, soy flour ..),

- Use of glucose oxidase enzyme instead of vitamin C,

-Using wheat with GDO (hexaploid).

Water activity is expressed as aw, which is the ratio of the vapor pressure of water in food to the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. It shows how the water in the food depends on the structure, and the degree and status of its use for microbiological activities with some chemical and enzymatic reactions. In other words, to summarize briefly, to control the water activity value of the product and to protect the product from further quality losses.

Foods with the same water content may vary in strength. Correlations between food processing and storage degradation and quality loss are best expressed by water activity. Preserving food has existed since the existence of human beings. For this reason, knowing the water activity of the food shows how you can process the food. Generally applied methods are drying, salting, freezing, sugar addition etc. (Fontana, 2000).

> **APPROXIMATE WATER ACTIVITY VALUES OF SOME**
> **FOODS** **WATER ACTIVITY**
> Dried vegetables, cake mixes, crackers 0,2-0,3
> Dried eggs, cocoa 0,4
> Chocolate, confectionery, honey 0,5-0,6
> Dried fruits, corn syrup 0,6-0,7
> Salted fish, dried figs (soft) 0,7-0,8
> Hungarian salami, jams 0,8-0,9
> Fresh meat, vegetables and fruits, orange juice concentrate 0,9-0,99

At temperatures below freezing point, water activity varies only with temperature and is not affected by the amount of solute present. At temperatures above the freezing point, the water activity varies depending on the temperature and composition of the substance.

Some of the water in the food is bound to substances such as protein, sugar, fat and some of it is free. Connected water is described by some researchers as the amount of water that does not freeze even at very low temperatures. In general, 5-10% of the cell water remains frozen. However, after a certain temperature, the amount of freezing water decreases. This is because many components of food are dissolved.

***Microbial growth***

Microbial growth is the event in which water activity is effective. There are limit values ​​of water activity that microorganisms can develop. Water activity refers to the amount of water available for microbial growth. Although the amount of water in the product is high, if the energy level is low for microorganisms, it will not be effective in their development. In this case, creating an osmotic imbalance between the organism and the environment prevents the development of microorganisms and causes their death.

Apart from the development of microorganisms, another important event related to the value of water activity is the formation of secondary products produced by these organisms that may be harmful to humans (Hussein et al., 2001).

Lactoferrin belongs to the transferrin protein superfamily and is a major component of the mammalian innate immune system. Proteolytic cleavage of either human or bovine lactoferrin results in the generation of severalpeptides, most of which manifest the protective activities of Lactoferrin. It is worth noting that these peptides may be naturally produced in the human intestine after milk ingestion. Interestingly, peptides deriving from proteolytic cleavage of Ovotransferrin, a Lactoferrin homologous protein present in reptiles and birds, displays the same protective activities. This mini-review summarizes the most relevant protective activities of peptides deriving from Lactoferrin and Ovotransferrin.

7781,1,"Hi, I'm Iryna, a food developer from Bulgaria. I've read your protein bar topic and I hope you've resolved it by now as it was posted quite some time ago.
I wonder what do you do with the flavors. I'd like to suggest trying 100% organic and really healthy liquid herbs and spices which are in fact oils, so you'll have your dryness problem partially handled via such addition to the recipe too. You can have virtually any flavor obtained in the healthiest way possible = by mechanical pressing and fermentation. Plus...your label by all legal requirements will say just the name of the herb/spice: cinnamon, cardamom, anise, etc. - not any kind of aroma, not extract, etc. Because our liquid herbs and spices are certified in the EU as food product and thus you'd have to identify just the variety and not any specific form, which gives you lots of marketing advantages + wow effect on the consumers.
We have a very strong culinary and R&D teams and could help you with the formulation all in all.

Nowadays food processing has reached a level that is hard to imagine. Food processing is almost omnipresent. Almost all food consumed in almost all settings is now processed in some way. Varied types of food processing have beneficial or even negative effects on food, diet quality, and human health .

A range of new food processing technologies has been investigated and developed to modify or replace traditional food processing techniques so that better quality and more consumer preference-oriented foods can be manufactured [2]. The focus has been on quality over the last decade, enhancing the process efficiency, safety, productivity, and stability of food products in a healthier way .

The nutritional quality of food is influenced by factors such as quality of raw material, transportation, processing techniques, packaging, storage, and the whole food chain (farm to fork) .


Several existing methods and techniques included in food processing are used in order to transform raw material ingredients into food for people’s consumption. Food processing implies the use of clean, butchered, and harvested components to manufacture food products for the market demand. There are numerous ways to produce food .

Nowadays, an impressive displacement process is taking place worldwide within alimentary production patterns and systems, with regard to the ready-for-consumption food, which replaces traditional food based on fresh meals. However, not much attention is being paid to food processing, when it comes to dietary guidelines, classifications of food products, or epidemiology studies.

Scientists in this industry regard food processing in various ways. Certain processes such as drying, nonalcoholic fermenting, skimming, pasteurization, freezing, and vacuum-packing are rightly considered as beneficial in the food industry. However, other processes are regarded as less beneficial or even harmful for human health, namely, charring, hydrogenation, carbon dioxide addition, alcoholic fermenting, salt-pickling, and sugaring.

Nowadays, a drastic change has been noticed in how compliance and its consequences are approached. Due to regulatory requirements, and to a much less tolerant and most knowledgeable public, the industry has been in the critical public eye and placed under a much more thorough scrutiny and examination than ever before. As a consequence, at the local and state levels, there has been an increasing demand of documentation, in terms of legislation. It is very difficult to make a mistake and have no one find out about it. In the end, we are actually all consumers and expect safe food. Legislation is seeing a lot of issues related to allergens, organics, and package labeling .

Food safety technology has greatly interfered with and changed the way food industry specialists identify, react to, and communicate on specific food safety issues. Thus, the Internet and social media have impacted the industry by allowing an instant information exchange, which, at times, can include true or even false data, hence rightly entitling food companies to have a correspondingly adequate reaction. The legislation regarding the food industry attempts to regulate the management of pests, sanitation, and contamination with fewer toxic materials.

Having said that, there will always be people trying to “beat” any law or system; consequently it is extremely important to plan for that by being able to identify issues with strong systems and processes. The trap, however, lies in believing that laws or government can control food safety. For managing the hazards involved and the control over food safety, the legislation needs to constantly improve alongside with its enforcement, according to the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) model.

1487,1,"**Understanding 'best before' and 'use-by' dates on food labels and how you must treat them differently.**



Food may contain bacteria and if stored for too long or at the wrong temperature, can cause food poisoning . So it’s important to understand the different types of dates and advice on food packaging.

## Use-by dates are about safety

A use-by date on food is about safety. This is the most important date to remember. Foods can be eaten until the use-by date but not after. You will see use-by dates on food that goes off quickly, such as meat products or ready-to-eat salads.

For the use-by date to be a valid guide, you must carefully follow storage instructions. For example, if the instructions on the packaging tell you to refrigerate after opening, you should keep the food in a fridge at 5°C or below. Find out more about chilling your food correctly.

After the use-by date, don't eat it, cook it or freeze it. The food could be unsafe to eat or drink, even if it has been stored correctly and looks and smells fine. A lot of foods including meat and milk, can be frozen before the use-by date though so plan ahead.

## Best before dates are about quality

The best before date, sometimes shown as BBE (best before end), is about quality and not safety. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best. Its flavour and texture might not be as good. Best before dates appear on a wide range of foods including:

* frozen foods
* dried foods
* tinned foods

The best before date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the packaging.


## Charity food banks

If you are supplying people with packaged food from a food bank, you still need to check and follow the use-by dates.

Giving out food after its ‘use by’ date puts people at risk, and could lead to enforcement action being taken against the food bank.

## Plan your meals ahead

Get into the habit of checking what you already have in the fridge and freezer before you go shopping. Look out for foods that are approaching their use-by date and other fresh foods that can go off over time and try to use them up first. This includes:

* fruit and vegetables
* meat and fish
* cheese, milk or other dairy products

## Don’t trust the sniff test

Food can look and smell fine even after its use-by date, but that doesn't mean it's safe to eat. It could still be contaminated.

You cannot see, smell or taste the bacteria that cause food poisoning.

## Freeze and defrost your food correctly

Food properly frozen won’t deteriorate and bacteria cannot grow in it, so when frozen it can’t become more unsafe. Once defrosted however, the pause button is off. Only defrost food as you need it and eat it within 24 hours. Find out more about freezing and defrosting food.

Once food has been defrosted, use it within 24 hours and cook it until steaming hot before serving.

## Abstract

The GMO Panel has previously assessed genetically modified (GM) soybean A2704‐12. This soybean was found to be as safe and nutritious as its conventional counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and the environment in the context of its intended uses. On 5 June 2018, the European Commission requested EFSA to analyse new nucleic acid sequencing data and updated bioinformatics data for GM soybean A2704‐12 and to indicate whether the previous conclusions of the GMO Panel on the risk assessment of GM soybean A2704‐12 remain valid. The new sequencing data indicated seven nucleotide differences as compared to the sequence originally provided in application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18; six nucleotides in the 3′ genomic flanking region and one nucleotide in the soybean chloroplast DNA fragment located 5′ to the insert. Another nucleotide located in a polylinker region of the insert reported as ambiguous in the originally submitted sequence was resolved in the new sequence data. Based on the information provided on the locations affected by the reported nucleotide differences, no open reading frames (ORFs) spanning the junction site between the insert and the 3′ genomic flanking DNA are affected by the differences in the 3′ genomic flanking region and were therefore excluded from the assessment. However, one ORF spanning the junction between the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment and the insert and six ORFs overlapping with the resolved nucleotide in the polylinker region were affected and therefore assessed. Based on the analysis of the provided data, EFSA considers that it is highly unlikely that the reported sequence differences (including the single nucleotide difference in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment) are due to spontaneous mutations and can therefore most likely be attributed to sequencing errors in the originally reported soybean A2704‐12 event sequence. With the exception of bioinformatic analyses, the studies performed for the risk assessment of soybean A2704‐12 are not affected. The new sequencing data and the bioinformatic analyses performed on the new sequence did not give rise to safety issues. Therefore, EFSA concludes that the original risk assessment of soybean A2704‐12 remains valid.

## 1 Introduction

Genetically modified (GM) soybean A2704‐12 was obtained via particle bombardment using a  *Pvu* I digested pB2/35SAcK plasmid and contains the  *pat*  expression cassette. The  *pat* expression cassette consists of the following elements: the P35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus, the synthetic  *pat*  gene derived from the  *pat*  gene of  *Streptomyces viridochromogenes*  and the T35S terminator from cauliflower mosaic virus. The  *pat*  gene encodes for the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) protein conferring tolerance of soybean A2704‐12 to glufosinate‐ammonium based herbicides.

The GMO Panel has previously assessed GM soybean A2704‐12 in the frame of application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18 (EFSA, [2007](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0001)). This the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) statement assesses the additional sequencing information received for the GM soybean event A2704‐12.

### 1.1 Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the requestor

On 24 August 2017, the European Commission (EC) received from Bayer new sequencing information related to soybean event A2704‐12, on the basis of Articles 9 and 21 of Regulation (EC) 1829/2003. On 5 June 2018, the EC requested EFSA to evaluate the data and analyses provided by Bayer and indicate whether, on the basis of these elements, the conclusions of the adopted opinion for GM soybean A2704‐12 remain valid. Subsequently, EFSA has evaluated the data and methodology provided for GM soybean A2704‐12 and considered these elements in the context of previous conclusions.

## 2 Data and methodologies

### 2.1 Data

In delivering this statement, EFSA took into account information provided by the applicant and relevant scientific publications.

### 2.2 Methodologies

The applicant followed the relevant parts of the GMO Panel guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants (EFSA GMO Panel, [2011](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0003)) to investigate the insert sequence and to perform the bioinformatics analyses. In delivering this statement, EFSA took into account the appropriate principles described in the GMO Panel guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants (EFSA GMO Panel, [2010](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0002), [2011](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0003)) and Regulation (EU) No 503/2013[1](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-note-5001).

### 2.3 Sequence information previously submitted to EFSA for GM soybean event A2704‐12

The applicant had previously submitted information on the sequence of GM soybean event A2704‐12, as part of application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18 (EFSA, [2007](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0001)). Soybean A2704‐12 contains a single insert. The 6780‐bp insert consists of two copies of the  *pat*  expression cassette and one copy each of the 5′ and 3′ parts of the  *PvuI* ‐digested β‐lactamase ( *bla* ) antibiotic resistance gene integrated between the two copies of the  *pat*  cassette. The 5′ part of the  *bla*  sequence was integrated in a reverse orientation with respect to the 3′  *bla* sequence part and hence the integration of these parts does not constitute a functional  *bla* gene. In addition, ~4 kb and ~0.3 kb of the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions, respectively, were sequenced. The analysis of the 5′ flanking region indicated also the integration of a soybean chloroplast DNA fragment located 5′ to the insert (hereinafter referred to as 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment) (EFSA, [2007](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0001)).

#### 2.3.1 New information for GM soybean event A2704‐12 submitted as part of the current mandate[2](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-note-1005)

The applicant has recently sequenced the soybean event A2704‐12 (insert and flanking regions) of an ‘early‐generation’ soybean A2704‐12 and a commercially available soybean A2704‐12 variety (on the market since 2016). In addition, the applicant sequenced the insertion locus of the non‐GM soybean A2704 variety (the same genetic background as the GM soybean A2704‐12). The applicant also provided updated sequencing reports on the A2704‐12 event sequence originally submitted in application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18.[3](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-note-1006) The comparison of the newly determined ‘early generation’ soybean A2704‐12 event sequence with the A2704‐12 sequence originally submitted to EFSA (in the frame of application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18) revealed a number of sequence differences; six nucleotides in the 3′ soybean genomic flanking region and one nucleotide in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment (Table [1](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-tbl-0001)). The applicant clarified that the positions of the sequence differences in the 3′ soybean genomic flanking sequence fall outside the region spanning the junction between the genomic DNA and the insert giving rise to newly created open reading frames (ORFs). As regards the sequence difference in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment at position 3802, this leads to the generation of a STOP codon that initiates one of the newly created ORFs spanning the junction between the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment and the insert resulting in an ORF that is nine amino acids shorter in the ‘early generation’ A2704‐12 sequence than the corresponding ORF in the originally submitted event sequence.

Another nucleotide located in the polylinker region of the insert between T35S and the 3′ of the  *bla*  gene (position 6244) described as ambiguous (R) in the originally submitted A2704‐12 event sequence is reported as a true base in the new sequencing data (see Table [1](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-tbl-0001)). The applicant clarified that six newly created ORFs overlap with position 6244 and are therefore affected by the new sequencing data.

The applicant performed further analyses and compared the early generation soybean A2704‐12 event sequence with the event sequence of the commercially available soybean A2704‐12 as well as with the non‐GM insertion locus sequence corresponding to the flanking regions; results indicate that the respective sequences are 100% identical in both cases.

|dentified difference|Position new A2704‐12 sequencea|Reported in application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18|Reported in the current mandateb|

|Polylinker region in the inserted sequence|6244|AAGRACA|AAGAACA|
|3′ flanking sequence|10813|ATAGAGA|ATAAAGA|

* *a*  Positions are defined as reported for the early generation GM soybean A2704‐12 sequence.
* *b*  The A2704‐12 event sequences derived from the early generation GM soybean A2704‐12 and from the soybean A2704‐12 commercial variety are 100% identical.

In order to generate the event sequence of soybean A2704‐12 defined by the applicant as ‘early generation soybean A2704‐12 sequence’, genomic DNA from pooled seeds of soybean A2704‐12 from the T4 generation (fourth generation after the original transformant) were used. The applicant clarified that it was not possible to precisely confirm the origin of the material used to generate the A2704‐12 sequence originally submitted in application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18. However, based on the available information, the applicant could deduce that the material used was either of the same generation (T4) as the one used to generate the early generation soybean A2704‐12 sequence or one generation earlier (T3, third generation after the original transformant). The sequence of the commercially available soybean A2704‐12 variety was produced using seeds from GM plants obtained after multiple self‐pollinated generations derived from the early generation soybean A2704‐12. For the newly obtained insertion locus sequence, genomic DNA from pooled seeds of the non GM soybean A2704 variety (the same genetic background as the GM soybean A2704‐12), were used.

The applicant provided a complete bioinformatics dataset using the updated A2704‐12 event sequence including an analysis of the insert and flanking sequences, an analysis of the potential similarity to allergens and toxins of the newly expressed protein and of all possible ORFs within the insert and spanning the junction sites, and an analysis of possible horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

## 3 Assessment

Based on the analysis of the information on the locations of the reported sequence differences, none of the newly created ORFs spanning the junction between the 3′ soybean genomic flanking DNA and the insert are affected by the sequence differences in the 3′ soybean genomic flanking region and were therefore excluded from the assessment.

On the other hand, one ORF spanning the junction between the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment and the insert is affected by the single nucleotide sequence difference in the 5′‐chloloplast DNA fragment and six ORFs are affected by the resolved base in the polylinker region of the insert. The bioinformatic analyses performed on these ORFs with regard to potential similarity with allergens or toxins as well as the implications of the newly determined event sequence on the potential for HGT were considered relevant for the current assessment. The results indicated that none of the possible ORFs (including the affected ORFs) within the insert or spanning all the junctions using the newly determined event sequence showed significant similarity with known allergens or toxins. Furthermore, sequence analysis using the updated A2704‐12 event sequence did not reveal sufficient identity with microbial sequences (EFSA, [2017](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5496#efs25496-bib-0004)). Therefore, the updated A2704‐12 sequence does not affect the likelihood of HGT. The complete updated bioinformatic analyses confirm all the previous conclusions for the A2704‐12 soybean event.

The other studies performed for the risk assessment of GM soybean event A2704‐12 are not affected by the new sequencing information.

On the basis of the available information, it cannot be confirmed whether the material used to produce the early generation soybean A2704‐12 event sequence is exactly the same material used to determine the original soybean A2704‐12 event sequence submitted in application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2005‐18 (T4 generation for the newly determined sequence and T3 or T4 generation for the originally reported sequence).

However, based on the analysis of the provided information including the 100% identity between the early generation (T4) and commercial variety GM soybean A2704‐12 sequences as well as the 100% identity between the genomic flanking regions of those sequences and the corresponding regions of the non‐GM soybean A2704 sequence, it can be concluded that it is highly unlikely that the reported sequence differences (including the single nucleotide difference in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment) are due to spontaneous mutations and these differences can therefore most likely be attributed to sequencing errors in the originally reported soybean A2704‐12 event sequence.

## 4 Conclusions

Analysis of the information on the locations of the reported nucleotide differences for the soybean A2704‐12 event indicated that out of the seven reported nucleotide differences, the six nucleotide differences in the 3′ soybean genomic flanking region and the single nucleotide in the 5′ ‐chloroplast DNA fragment, only the latter affects one of the newly created ORFs spanning the junction between the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment and the insert. In addition, a single nucleotide located in the polylinker region of the insert and reported as ambiguous in the originally submitted A2704‐12 event sequence is resolved in the new sequencing data. The ORF affected by the nucleotide difference in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment together with the six ORFs affected by the resolved base in the polylinker region were considered relevant for the current assessment and were therefore assessed. The complete bioinformatic analyses using the newly determined complete event sequence (including the affected ORFs) did not give rise to safety issues. Studies other than bioinformatics are not affected by this new sequence information.

Although it cannot be theoretically excluded, based on the analysis of the provided data, EFSA considers it highly unlikely that the reported sequence differences (including the single nucleotide difference in the 5′‐chloroplast DNA fragment) are due to spontaneous mutations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reported sequence differences can most likely be attributed to sequencing errors in the originally reported soybean A2704‐12 event sequence. EFSA concludes that the original risk assessment of the GM soybean A2704‐12 remains valid.

#### Abstract

The objective of this work was to determine the effects of blanching and two drying methods, open-sun drying and natural convection solar drying, on the quality characteristics of red pepper. A 2 × 3 factorial design with experimental factors as 2 drying methods (open-sun drying and use of solar dryer) and 3 levels of pepper blanching (unblanched, blanched in plain water, and blanched in 2% NaCl) was conducted. 

Dried pepper samples were analysed for chemical composition, microbial load, and consumer sensory acceptability. Blanching of pepper in 2% NaCl solution followed by drying in a natural convection solar dryer reduced drying time by 15 hours. Similarly, a combination of blanching and drying in the solar dryer improved microbial quality of dried pepper. 

However, blanching and drying processes resulted in reduction in nutrients such as vitamin C and minerals content of pepper. Blanching followed by drying in natural convection solar dryer had the highest consumer acceptability scores for colour and overall acceptability, while texture and aroma were not significantly () affected by the different treatments. 

Therefore, natural convection solar dryer can be used to dry pepper with acceptable microbial and sensory qualities, as an alternative to open-sun drying.

Donkey milk can be used as a substitute for infants and children who suffer from cow milk proteins intolerance and multiple food hypersensitivity. Up to date, this is one of the main reasons why donkey milk has become a substantial area for reasearch, with an increase over the the last fifteen years. 

In donkey milk chain, risk analysis should be the object of particular attention because children are the main consumers of this food. In fact, this process is one of the main tool to achieve a high level of protection of human health and life; thus, the most important safety hazards should be monitored in order to attain this goal. 

This review focuses on the main hazards possibly present in raw donkey milk, including bacteria, fungal toxins, parasites, and chemical pollutants. Literature data have been considered, including some information that is not provided in the international literature. In the authors’ opinion, the current scientific knowledge should be improved, with the aim of allowing a suitable risk assessment along the whole donkey milk chain. 

However, in the meantime, the competent authorities must carry out more stringent official controls, with particular attention given to the level of primary production. The issue of a traceability system in donkey milk chain should be considered of paramount importance.

I'm very curious about aging of grains and pulses. How to know if grains or pulses you purchased from market to manufacture a food product is fresh or old?

Using old raw material can deteriorate the finished product and to prevent this what test should be done or machinery required.

As of my knowledge I think when grains or pulses getting old, kept in store houses for long period they develop some toxins on them or maybe their nutritional composition start to decrease.

So what are the specific components I should test before buying raw material?

3901,1,"Essential in the metabolism of all living organisms, the enzymes are increasingly used to drive chemical reactions outside their natural localization. In particular, the use of the biocatalysts as food additives and in processing raw materials has been practiced for a long time. In fact, enzymatic preparations from the extracts of plants or animal tissues were used well before much was known about the nature and properties of enzymes.

Food industry is constantly seeking advanced technologies to meet the demand of the consumers, and enzymes have long been used by the industrial product makers as major tools to transform the raw materials into end-products. Their clean label (GRAS, generally recognized as safe) consideration from the legal point of view has prompted their extensive use in food technology.

When purified and added to food preparations, several enzymes are able to improve their flavor, texture, digestibility, and nutritional value. However, it was not until the mid of the past century that the rapid development in protein technology occurred, and only in the last 30 years, the use of commercial enzymes has grown in the food industry, progressively becoming an important aspect of the manufacturing of meat, vegetables, fruit, baked goods, milk products, and both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.

As a matter of fact, an increasing number of articles, mostly describing the enhanced product yields, have been published during the last ten years, both in food and beverage manufacturing.

Moreover, since it is desirable in different branches of food technology to change the physical and chemical properties of protein, many previously unexplored enzymes are currently employed to produce a variety of foods in which the biocatalysts replace potentially carcinogenic or otherwise harmful chemicals. This includes also new methods in which the characteristics of natural products are altered to fit the nutritional or technological needs changing.

The economic benefit of using technical enzyme preparations lies in lowered process costs, in the reduction of the environmental impact by making use of renewable resources, and often in increasing the quality of the products. Also, preservation makes a significant impact on the quality of food as well of beverages. It is well known, for example, that modern processes convert juices into concentrates that, except for aroma, can be stored for a long time without loss in quality. Stabilizing flavor and color is also an example of improved preservation.

Finally, the advent of biotechnology has also allowed significant refinements in the methodologies offering unpredictable solutions to many persistent problems and opening up exciting new possibilities.

Among these, enzymes are proposed as exemplary agents of “green” technology since they can also be used either to treat the biological wastes or to prevent their formation. Currently used enzymes sometimes originate in animals and plants but most come from a range of beneficial microorganisms.

Thus, numerous purified enzymes are now being widely used not only in food processing but also as food additives. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the enzymes, like all proteins, can cause reactions only when people have been sensitized through exposure to large quantities. Therefore, since their levels in the food are generally very low, the enzymes are highly unlikely to cause allergies.

This special issue of Enzyme Research is devoted to contribute to highlight some expanding fields of enzyme applications in food technology, mostly explaining how some different biocatalysts bring advantages in some food processing improvement and innovation. It comprises six review articles and three research articles.

The first review article is a condensed and concise overview on the applications of enzymes in food and feed processing, outlining the development of better biocatalysts through microbial screening, protein engineering, and immobilization techniques. The second review article summarizes the nutritional, technological, and environmental advances in meat products and, in particular, the application of the proteolytic enzymes, phytases, and transglutaminase in the meat industry.

Transglutaminase, as well as bacterial-derived endopeptidases, are the subject of the third review article which reports the most recent developments of the attempts to detoxify gluten.

The fourth and the fifth review articles describe, respectively, the uses of laccases as additives in food and beverage processing and the production, function, and applications in food industry of fungal laccases. The last review article has been focused on the different types of techniques used for the immobilization of *β* -galactosidase and its potential applications in food and dairy processing industries.


The three research articles describe (i) a new glucose biosensor based on a screen-printed carbon electrode modified by glucose dehydrogenase immobilized on its surface, (ii) the preparation of antioxidant hydrolysates of honeybee-collected pollen by using proteinase and aminopeptidases of plant origin, and (iii) the characterization of a potential food-grade leucine aminopeptidase extracted from kiwifruit.

We sincerely hope that the present volume may represent only the first of a special issue series in which Enzyme Research will periodically stimulate authors to publish the highlights and original research articles reporting how enzymes bring new advantages in food preparation improvement and innovation.

Application of supercritical carbon dioxide for processing of food products has an impact on microbial inactivation and food quality. This technique is used to preserve tempeh due to no heat involved. 
<!-- Admatic STANDARD ads START -->
<ins data-publisher=""adm-pub-7853964608"" data-ad-network=""675266b5fed394e4c63ed50f""  data-ad-size=""[[300, 250]]"" class=""adm-ads-area""></ins>

<!-- Admatic STANDARD ads END -->
The quality of tempeh is highly influenced by mold growth because of its role in forming a compact texture, white color, and functional properties as well as consumer acceptance.

 This study aims to observe viability of molds and bacteria in tempeh after processed with supercritical CO2 and to determine the best processing conditions which can maintain mold growth and reduce the number of bacteria in tempeh. For that purpose, tempeh was treated using high pressure CO2 at 7.6 MPa (supercritical CO2) and at 6.3 MPa (sub/near supercritical CO2) with incubation period of 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The best treatment obtained was used to process tempeh for storage study.

 The results showed that there was a significant interaction between pressure and incubation period for bacterial and mold viability at  *ρ* &gt;0.05. Reduction of bacteria and molds increased with longer incubation period. Molds were undetectable after treatment for 20 min with either supercritical CO2 or sub-supercritical, and bacteria significantly reduced up to 2.40 log CFU/g. On the other hand, sub-supercritical CO2 for 10 min was the best processing method because molds survived 4.3x104 CFU/gram after treatment and were able to grow during storage at 30°C, producing white mycelium as indicated by increasing the  color value and tempeh acceptability. 

The inactivation of mold was reversible causing it to grow back during storage under suitable conditions. Tempeh matrix composition can provide protection against the destructive effects of supercritical CO2. Gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than Gram-negative. In conclusion, sub-supercritical CO2 can act as a method of cold pasteurization of tempeh and can be used as an alternative method to preserve tempeh.

Industrial sectors with top-down and bottom-up approaches are currently focusing on improving microbial amylase production levels by implementing bioengineering technologies. 

The further support of energy consumption studies, such as those on thermodynamics, pinch technology, and environment-friendly technologies, has hastened the large-scale production of the enzyme. Herein, the importance of microbial (bacteria and fungi) amylase is discussed along with its production methods from the laboratory to industrial scales.

It provides equipment revisions by measuring the design and modeling of new industrial processes and the efficiency of existing equipment. Allows integration with BIM-enabled software and allows modeling. For example, in drier systems, two different parameters are emphasized, static or convective examination of the current in the dryer is done by analyzing the elastic modulus, temperature and air drying during the flow processing. The most important feature is to reach the desired results without creating a prototype."
7575,1,"
Even if your business’s **HACCP** is highly effective in theory, it won’t prevent contamination unless actual practice lines up with documentation. Regular audits can ensure employee practice complies.

HACCPs are structured around identifying both potential food hazards and [critical control points] (CCPs) where your system has the opportunity to prevent, mitigate or eliminate a potential issue. Usually, this means storing food items or performing some biological, physical or chemical action to a target limit— like a specific temperature—to prevent or mitigate contamination.

For example, in the manufacturing of chicken products, cooking and hot-holding are critical control points at which the product needs to be heated to a certain temperature to eliminate or prevent potential hazards. Here, an audit would be a chance to ensure employees cooked and hot-held foods at the proper temperatures. If they aren’t, the food safety management team can make policy changes that ensure practice lines up with planning.

The audit process should be consistent and occur regularly. It should also cover every aspect of your HACCP strategy and place a particular focus on potential hazards and CCPs. These audits can be a way to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of your current HACCP strategy. Companies can use this information to build upon existing practices or demonstrate how procedures could be more effective."

5593,1,"High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment has been described to improve the microbiological safety and shelf life of ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products, as a nonthermal decontamination technology in the meat industry, applied at pre- or post-packaging. 


The pathogen widely studied in this product is Listeria monocytogenes that reflects the concern of the food industry. In general, microorganism’s lethality during HHP treatment depends on specific intrinsic factors of the microorganism; those factors are related to food and technological factors of treatment. In addition to processing parameters, intrinsic factors of the food matrix also exert an effect on bacteria inactivation during pressure treatment. It is known that low water activity (aw) protects microorganisms against the effects of pressure. 

Predictive modelling is an important tool of the novel microbial food safety management strategy that provides with accurate information to demonstrate and guarantee the safety and shelf life of the food products. The chapter describes the effect of parameters on the efficiency of this technology on meat products over pathogens, composition and the sensorial quality consequences. The predictive modelling tool is introduced for the optimisation of meat treatment.

Irradiation is physical treatment of food with high-energy ionising radiation to:

* Destroy micro-organisms, viruses, bacteria or insects
* Prevent germination and sprouting of potatoes, onions and garlic
* Slow down ripening and ageing of fruit and vegetables
* Prolong the shelf life and prevent food-borne diseases in meat, poultry and seafood

Its use is limited but authorised in many countries.

### When is food irradiation authorised?

Treating food with ionising radiation may be authorised if:

* there is reasonable technological need
* it poses no health hazard
* it benefits consumers
* it does not replace hygiene, health or good manufacturing or agricultural practice

Irradiated food or one containing irradiated ingredients  **must be labelled** .

Food irradiation  **has nothing to do with radioactive contamination**  of food resulting from a spill or an accident.

Microbiology refers to the study of microorganisms. As the name suggests, microorganisms are organisms that are so small they can only be seen using a microscope. 


Bacteria, fungi (such as yeasts and molds), protozoa, viruses, algae, and some parasites are all types of microorganisms. Some people also list prions as microorganisms even though they are proteins and not actually organisms. 

Unfortunately, microorganisms also can be detrimental. They are the cause of many diseases in humans, animals, and plants. 

Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. A pathogen, or the substances it produces, must invade the human, animal, or plant body to cause illness.

While many diseases are transmissible from person to person or from animals to humans, only a few are transmitted through foods. 

Diseases that are caused by eating food are usually referred to as food poisoning or foodborne illnesses. This guidebook serves as a broad and very basic introduction to the microorganisms associated with food production, and in particular, bacterial pathogens.

  **Economic Importance**

The fruit of guava is very rich in Vitamin C, which is substantially higher than what is found in citrus. It is also a good source of Vitamin A and other important elements. The fruit contains a large amount of citric, lactic, malic, oxalic and acetic acids and a trace amount of formic acid.

The ripe fruit is usually eaten as a dessert. It can also be utilized in many ways for making jellies, jam, paste, juice, baby foods, puree, beverage base, syrup, wine and other processed products. It may be eaten sliced with cream and sugar and as ingredient in cakes and pies. It is also used in dishes like “sinigang”.

Some parts of guava tree have medicinal and commercial usefulness. The bark and leaves are used in childbirth to expel the placenta. The leaves can be made into tea and astringent decoction can cure stomachache and act as vermifuge. When crushed or chewed, it is used for toothache treatment; pounded leaves may also be applied locally for rheumatism; can also be used for dyeing and tanning. The bark is sometimes used in complex cosmetics for hystero-epilepsy. Its wood is moderately strong and durable indoor and useful for handle and in carpentry and turnery.

 **Guava Varieties**

**Supreme** – The Supreme varieties from Florida. It is generally high yielding and produces a thick white flesh fruit of good quality for preserving or eating fresh. Fruit shape is ovate with distinct corrugation, 6.3 cm long, 5.5 cm in diameter and weighing 65 grams. The three is moderately prolific and regular bearing. When fully ripe, the fruit is bright yellow in color. The flavor in the inner pulp is sweet but the outer skin is slightly bitter and possesses a distinct strawberry wine odor, which is slightly astringent. It is moderately resistant to anthracnose and fruitfly but susceptible to leaf folder and aphids.

**Red Indian Rolfs and Ruby** – the fruit is ovate, 6.5 cm long, 5 cm in diameter with thin, smooth, medium green skin, weighing 75 grams. The fruit pulp is about 10 mm deep and red when fully ripe and has less pronounced corrugation. It is large seeded, sparsely populated but very sweet, juicy, crunchy and possesses a strong aroma. The tree is very prolific, regular bearing but easily attack by bats, moderately to anthracnose and oriental fruitfly.

**Crosses between Ruby and Supreme** – a large, white flesh variety from California, U.S.A.

**Seedless variety** – this variety has a fleshy layer, thick, that almost no seed cavity remained

**Goyena Quezo de Bola (NSIC 02 Gv-01)** – this is NSIC guava variety approved in 2002, being a prolific yielder possessing yellowish green color of skin, finely smooth texture with pleasant aroma and weigh 575 g/fruit.

**03. Processing and Utilization**

**Guava Wine**

Select ripe and sound fruits. Cut into quarters. To 1 part fruits, add 2 parts water. Boil until the fruits are soft. Strain and measure the extract. To every three (3) parts extract, add 1 part sugar. Stir and measure the extract. Cool. To every 15 to 15 liters, add one-tablespoon yeast. Place in demijohns to ferment. This will take from two weeks or longer. When the fermentation is completed, transfer into wine barrels and age for at least one year.

**Guava Jelly**

Select equal mixture of green and ripe guavas. Wash and cut into halves or quarters. For every kilo of guavas, add 2 liters of water. Boil in enamel or stainless steel basin for 30 minutes. Strain thru a cheesecloth bag. Crush the pulp and boil again, using 1-½ liters of water. Strain and combine the 2 extracts. Measure. To every cup of the extract, add ¾ cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of calamansi juice. Boil once to dissolve sugar and strain. Cook over strong fire until the temperature reaches 107o-108o until a soft ball is formed when the jelly is dropped in a cup of water. Pour in sterilized dry glass jars.

**04 Nutritional Importance of Guava**

* Quercetin is considered as most active antioxidant in the guava leaves and is responsible for its spasmolytic activity.
* It is well known that guava is frequently employed in numerous parts of the world for the cure of a lot of sickness like diarrhea reducing fever, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hypertension, diabetes, caries, pain relief and wounds.
* Guava leaf’s extract doses can reduce the amount of cough due to its anti-cough activity. Aqueous, chloroform and methanol extract of leaves can reduce the growth of different bacteria.
* Guava leaves have high antibacterial activity in extracts that can inhibit the growth of *S. aureus* . Plant leaf and bark methanolic extracts of *P. guajava* have high antimicrobial activity. These extracts can inhibit the *Bacillus* and *Salmonella* bacteria [[31](https://clinphytoscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40816-018-0093-8#ref-CR31)]. Methanolic extract of guava contains a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Species of *Bacillus* and *Salmonella* bacteria can be controlled by these extracts.
* Guava leaves have quercetin-3-arabinoside and quercetin which can be isolated from leaves. Its leaves contain a compound which has morphine like action. It controls the muscular tone. Quercetin repressed intestinal contraction encouraged by enhanced absorption of calcium. Quercetin has a strong effect on ileum. It is thought that quercetin in guava leaf are responsible for its spasmolytic activity. Guava has high cytotoxicity [[46](https://clinphytoscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40816-018-0093-8#ref-CR46)]. Guava can be used to treat the diarrhea caused by the *E. coli* or *S. aureus* toxins.
* Extract of guava in ethyl acetate can stop the germ infection and thymus production. It can act as anti-viral agent. It can enhance the mRNA expression. Guava can alter the heme oxygenase-1 protein’s work. And due to this reason, it can be used as anti-inflammatory agent for skin. Extract of guava in ethanol inhibit the lipopolysaccharide from manufacturing of nitric oxide. It suppresses the expression of E2. In this way it works as anti-inflammatory agent [[53](https://clinphytoscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40816-018-0093-8#ref-CR53)].

* Guava contains high amount of antioxidants and anti-providing nutrients which are essential not only for life but also help to control the free radical activities. It also have a variety of phytochemicals which are beneficial for human health like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. There are two common methods by which antioxidants neutralize free radicals that is DPPH and FRAP assay. Extracts of guava in water and organic solvents have a large quantity of antioxidants which can stop the oxidation reaction. The concentration of these compounds become high with the increase in concentration [[58](https://clinphytoscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40816-018-0093-8#ref-CR58)]. 
Pink guava also has a high antioxidant activity
* Guava is highly rich in antioxidants (protocatechuic acid, quercetin, ferulic acid, ascorbic acid, quercetin, gallic acid and caffeic acid ) which are helpful in decreasing the incidences of degenerative diseases such as brain dysfunction, inflammation, heart disease, cancer, arteriosclerosis and arthritis.

* Guava extracts in organic solvent influence the sperm production. It can increase sperm concentration due to the presence of antioxidants. An ethanolic extract can increase sperm quality and quantity. So, it can be used for the treatment of infertile males."

3349,1,"Use of the powerful gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 could help to breed cacao trees that exhibit desirable traits such as enhanced resistance to diseases

— By Penn State

The cacao tree, which grows in tropical regions, produces the cocoa beans that are the raw material of chocolate. Reliable productivity from cacao plants is essential to the multibillion-dollar chocolate industry, the economies of producing countries and the livelihoods of millions of smallholder cacao farmers.

But each year, several plant diseases severely limit global production, with 20-30 percent of cocoa pods destroyed preharvest, notes lead author Andrew Fister, postdoctoral scholar in plant science, College of Agricultural Sciences, Penn State.
<script async src=""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7453434486769551""

</script>

“In West Africa, severe outbreaks of fungal diseases can destroy all cacao fruit on a single farm,” says Fister. “Because diseases are a persistent problem for cacao, improving disease resistance has been a priority for researchers. But development of disease-resistant varieties has been slowed by the need for sources of genetic resistance and the long generation time of cacao trees.”

The researchers report the study results in Frontiers in Plant Science, which are thought to be the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using cutting-edge CRISPR technology to improve Theobroma cacao.


CRISPR stands for ‘clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.’ It is a way to modify an organism’s genome by precisely delivering a DNA-cutting enzyme, Cas9, to a targeted region of DNA. The resulting change can delete or replace specific DNA pieces, thereby promoting or disabling certain traits.

Previous work in cacao identified a gene, known as TcNPR3, that suppresses the plant’s disease response. The researchers hypothesized that using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out this gene would result in enhanced disease resistance.

To test their hypothesis, they used Agrobacterium — a plant pathogen modified to remove its ability to cause disease — to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 components into detached cacao leaves. Subsequent analysis of treated tissue found deletions in 27 percent of TcNPR3 copies. When infected with Phytopthera tropicalis, a naturally occurring pathogen of cacao and other plants, the treated leaves showed greater resistance to the disease. The results suggested that the mutation of only a fraction of the copies of the targeted gene may be sufficient to trigger downstream processes, resulting in systemic disease resistance in the plant.

The researchers also created CRISPR gene-edited cacao embryos, which they will grow into mature trees to test the effectiveness of this approach at a whole-plant level.

This research builds on more than 30 years of biotechnology research aimed at building a better cacao tree, according to senior author Mark Guiltinan, professor of plant molecular biology and leader of Penn State’s endowed cocoa research program.

“Our lab has developed several tools for the improvement of cacao, and CRISPR is just one more tool,” he says. “But compared to conventional breeding and other techniques, CRISPR speeds up the process and is much more precise. It’s amazingly efficient in targeting the DNA you want, and so far, we haven’t detected any off-target effects.”

In addition to providing a new tool to accelerate breeding, CRISPR-Cas9 technology can help deliver insights into basic biology by offering a method to efficiently assess gene function, the researchers say.

“With CRISPR, we can quickly ‘break’ a gene and see what happens to the plant,” Guiltinan explains. “We have a list of genes in the pipeline that we want to test.”

There may be thousands of genes involved in disease resistance, Fister adds. “We want to evaluate as many as we can,” he says.

The ultimate goals of Penn State cacao research are to help raise the standard of living for smallholder growers and stabilize a threatened cocoa supply by developing plants that can withstand diseases, climate change and other challenges, according to co-author Siela Maximova, senior scientist and professor of horticulture.

“Any production increases in the last 20 years have been mostly due to putting more land into production,” says Maximova, who co-directs the cacao research program. “But land, water, fertilizer and other inputs are limited. To enhance sustainability, we need plants that are more vigorous and disease resistant and that produce more and better-quality beans.

“This study provides a ‘proof of concept’ that CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be a valuable tool in the effort to achieve these goals,” she says.

Protecting the consumer rights and preventing unfair competition are the basis of the regulations and policies. The European Union took the first step towards plant-based dairy products in 2010. Until this year, the term ""milk"" was not allowed to be used for plant-based foods. In the decision taken by the European Union Commission (2010/791), some products were included in the ""exception"" category and stated that they could use dairy products terminology. This use is left to the discretion of the member states. For example, although the phrase ""almond milk"" is allowed in France and Spain, it is not allowed in Romania, Germany or United Kingdom. The United States of America allows the phrase ""milk"" for plant-based dairy products with the decision of the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). In addition, before the FDA decision, United States Court ruled that ""a reasonable (sane) consumer can realize the difference between soy milk and cow milk."" According to Turkish Food Codex, the use of ""milk"" in plant-based dairy products is prohibited, but according to the 2nd part of the Regulation on Food Labeling and Consumer Information, the phrases ""contains pork"" or ""for vegetarians and vegans"" are allowed, taking into account the sensitivities of the consumers. As can be seen, there are still legal deficiencies related to the subject. More precise steps should be taken regarding the products.

Abstract

The physical, chemical, thermal, rheological, and sensory characteristics of spreads with noncarbohydrate nutritive sweeteners (such as polyols), produced on ball mill, could be predicted. Spreads with 70 and 100% maltitol, as a sweetener, produced on different temperatures (30, 35, 40°C) and mixer speed rotations (60, 80, 100 r/min), give the spreads with very good or excellent sensory characteristics, characteristic spreadability without sandiness (gritty texture), good melting behavior, and pleasant taste. 

Both process parameters are very important and have the dual effect on spread quality. The best spread quality, considering all characteristics, has the spread with 100% maltitol, produced on the highest process parameters (40°C, 100 r/min).

Low-energy foods, or products with reduced energy value, are very popular among the consumers. There is a need for developing the new and enriched existing products nowadays. The consumers’ awareness is raised. They want to primarily satisfy the need for the sweet taste, as well as for maintaining or reducing your body weight, without any consequences for your health [1].

Replacement of nutritive sweeteners with other low-energy sweeteners (such as polyols) can change the sensory characteristics of the basic product. Proper selection of raw materials, as well as proper management of the technological process, can obtain the products with optimal sensory properties [2].

This chapter should explain the possibility of native sugar substitution with
sugar alternatives, such as polyols (maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol, erythritol).

Polyols are the most suitable nutritive sugar substitute for confectionery products, such as chocolate, chocolate desserts/bars, spreads and cocoa cream products, hard/soft candies or chewing gums, bakery products, and nonalcoholic beverages.
Choosing an adequate polyol, as a sugar (sucrose) nutritive substitute, gives the possibility for a product that has almost unchanged sensory properties and that has maintained a sweet taste. This information is of crucial importance for industrial production. It provides important technological parameters and information for changing the process parameters and the need for new equipment:

1. Polyols are very stable at high temperatures and do not react with amino acids.
Generally, polyols [3] have about 40–50% less energy value than sucrose that has significantly more stability than monosaccharides from which they are produced because they do not have a carbonyl group.

2. Do not participate in caramelization and Maillard reactions.

3. Do not ferment in the oral cavity and therefore do not cause caries having a pleasant and neutral taste.

4. Give the feeling of cooling, especially sorbitol and xylitol.

Yoghurt samples A (Control), B, C, D and E were respectively produced at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of milk incorporated with papaya fruit. Incorporation of PPF into the yogurt samples resulted in an increase in pH, proteins and carbohydrates and a reduction in titratable acidity as compared to the control. The microbial analysis showed no presence of coliform bacteria. The sensory evaluation result demonstrated significant differences in all the organoleptic attributes analyzed. Sample C with 10% incorporated papaya had the highest overall acceptability score.

It is the most important quality parameter of chips and is mainly depends on frying temperature, time and variety of fruit. Fully matured, unripe and deseeded jackfruit bulbs were cut into approximately 15×4 mm by using jackfruit cutting machine and were fried at different vacuum levels using refined sunflower oil at three different temperature and time such as 80, 90 and 100 °C for 15, 20 and 25 minutes respectively. 

The processed jackfruit chips were studied with the full factorial design (FFD). Results showed that the chips out-turn, oil absorption by chips and physicochemical characteristics like tristimulus color, and crispiness of fried jackfruit chips were significantly related to vacuum level, frying temperature and time. The results indicate that colour and crispiness were significantly correlated with frying temperature, time and vacuum level.

What do you think about GMOs? 

Here are some explanations from [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/agricultural-biotechnology).

![image|690x439](upload://86mjYpeDoZVDLyWEGP4NciTJ9Pa.png)  

![image|690x447](upload://tTl1GDu8anHWVJ3VBm60vojRn82.png)  

![image|690x426](upload://f4nhK7y4JZusDCtQOwogq63PY7o.png) 

GMO foods have been available to consumers since the early 1990s. Since then, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have worked together to ensure that crops produced through genetic engineering are safe for people, animals, and the environment. 

Despite there being a wide range of foods—GMO and non-GMO—available to consumers, there is some confusion around what GMOs are and how they are used in our food supply.

**GMOs 101: Your Basic Questions Answered**



To help increase consumer understanding of GMOs, in 2017, Congress provided funding for an Agricultural Biotechnology Education and Outreach Initiative, which calls upon FDA to work with EPA and USDA to share science-based educational information about GMOs, beginning with answers to some basic GMO questions.

## What makes it a GMO?

A GMO (genetically modified organism) is a plant, animal, or microorganism that has had its genetic material (DNA) changed using technology that generally involves the specific modification of DNA, including the transfer of specific DNA from one organism to another. Scientists often refer to this process as genetic engineering.

## Is it called GMO or something else?

""GMO” has become the common term consumers and popular media use to describe foods that have been created through genetic engineering. This term is not generally used to refer to plants or animals developed with selective breeding, like the common garden strawberries available today that were created from a cross between a species native to North America and a species native to South America. While “genetic engineering” is the term typically used by scientists, you will start seeing the “bioengineered” label on some of the foods we eat in the United States because of the new National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard.


## Why do we have GMOs?

Humans have used traditional ways to modify crops and animals to suit their needs and tastes for more than 10,000 years. Cross-breeding, selective breeding, and mutation breeding are examples of traditional ways to make these changes. These breeding methods often involve mixing all of the genes from two different sources. They are used to create common crops like modern corn varieties and seedless watermelon.

Modern technology now allows scientists to use genetic engineering to take just a beneficial gene, like insect resistance or drought tolerance, and transfer it into a plant. The reasons for genetic modification today are similar to what they were thousands of years ago: higher crop yields, less crop loss, longer storage life, better appearance, better nutrition, or some combination of these traits.

## Do GMOs affect your health?

GMO foods are as healthful and safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts. Some GMO plants have actually been modified to improve their nutritional value.

An example is GMO soybeans with healthier oils that can be used to replace oils that contain  *trans*  fats. Since GMO foods were introduced in the 1990s, has shown that they are just as safe as non-GMO foods.

Additionally, External Link Disclaimer shows that GMO plants fed to farm animals are as safe as non-GMO animal food.



## Do GMO plants reduce pesticide use?

Some GMO plants contain [plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) to make them resistant to insects, reducing the need for and use of many [spray pesticides. As another safety measure, EPA works with developers and scientists to help develop GMOs that will resist insects for as long as possible through their Insect Resistance Management program. Other GMO plants are developed to tolerate certain weed killers, which allows farmers a wide variety of options for weed control. Some people are concerned that farmers who grow these GMOs will use more weed killer. While this is sometimes the case, EPA regulates the safety of all weed killers that farmers use on GMO crops and non-GMO crops alike. EPA also shares information to help farmers who are concerned about weeds developing resistance to weed killers."

Hello everyone,

I’m jumping into the journey of making red wine in small scale in an artisan way. After some research I have come up with the following proposed process: 

1. First fermentation (2-3 wks) until desired alcohol content. 

2. Second fermentation (2 months), including clarification process. 

3. Bottling aging (2-3 months). I’m aware that the longer the wine ages the better flavor and body it will achieve, however, and since it’s a small project for now, I can’t leave it too long. 

With the above mentioned I would appreciate a lot any feedback and comments you might have on the process proposed. 

In addition, I would like to be able to reach a shelf life of at least one year with this wine, do you guys have recommendations on what should be done to reach this goal? 

Besides the use of bactericide additives, should I also pasteurize the wine at the end in the sealed bottles?

Thanks a lot in advance for any help you can provide!"
8672,1,"Hi everyone,
I'm developing a recipe for a cake with aw similar to a brownie, aiming to a shelf-life of approximately 6 months in ambient temperature. 
For achieving the shelf-life, I'm considering adding the necessary preservatives, apply MAP, and packaging of aluPP/PP.
My questions are:
	1.	Do you think the addition of humectants will also be needed for preventing the product from getting dry? If so, would you recommend glycerol or another humectant, and approximately in what quantities?
	2.	Do you find any of the above steps unnecessary for achieving the shelf-life, and does any additional step needed?
	3.	Concerning preservatives, I'm considering adding Sorbic acid in 2000 ppm, which is in compliance with the national regulation. Do you think it will be sufficient for the specific product or do you suggest some other ones?

Thanks very much in advance."

Pulsed electric fields PEF is a non-thermal method of food preservation that uses short pulses of electricity for microbial inactivation and causes minimal detrimental effect on food quality attributes. PEF technology aims to offer consumers high-quality foods. For food quality attributes, PEF technology is considered superior to traditional thermal processing methods because it avoids or greatly reduces detrimental changes in the sensory and physical properties of foods. PEF technology aims to offer consumers high-quality foods. For food quality attributes, PEF technology is considered superior to traditional thermal processing methods because it avoids or greatly reduces detrimental changes in the sensory and physical properties of foods .

PEF technology has been presented as advantageous in comparison to, for instance, heat treatments, because it kills microorganisms while better maintaining the original color, flavor, texture, and nutritional value of the unprocessed food. PEF technology involves the application of pulses of high voltage to liquid or semi-solid foods placed between two electrodes. Most PEF studies have focused on PEF treatments effects on the microbial inactivation in milk, milk products, egg products, juice and other liquid foods . However, whereas a considerable amount of research papers have been published on the microbial aspects of food preservation by PEF, a lesser amount of information is available about the effect of this technology on food constituents and overall quality and acceptability. Recently, the interest in application of pulsed electric fields (PEF) for food processing has revived. The PEF treatment was shown to be very effective for inactivation of microorganisms, increasing the pressing efficiency and enhancing the juice extraction from food plants, and for intensification of the food dehydration and drying , Pulsed electric field technology (PEF) is viewed as one of the most promising nonthermal methods for inactivating microorganisms in foods. Electric fields in the range of 5-50 kV/cm generated by the application of short high voltage pulses (µs) between two electrodes cause microbial inactivation at temperatures below those used in thermal processing. The precise mechanisms by which microorganisms are inactivated by pulsed electric fields are not well understood; however, it is generally accepted that PEF leads to the penneabilization of microbial membranes.

Non-thermal processes have gained importance in recent years due to the increasing demand for foods with a high nutritional value and fresh-like characteristics, representing an alternative to conventional thermal treatments. Pulsed electric fields (PEF) is an emerging technology that has been extensively studied for non-thermal food processing. PEF processing has been studied by a number of researchers across a wide range of liquid foods. Apple and orange juices are among the foods most often treated in PEF studies. The sensory attributes of juices are reported to be well preserved, and the shelf life is extended. Yogurt drinks, apple sauce, and salad dressing have also been shown to retain a fresh-like quality with extended shelf life after processing. Other PEF-processed foods include milk, tomato juice and liquid egg products.

Food preservation technologies are based on the prevention of microbial growth or on the microbial inactivation. In many cases, foods are preserved by inhibiting microbial activity through those factors that most effectively influence the growth and survival of microorganisms such as temperature, water activity, addition of preservatives, pH, and modified atmosphere. In this case, the microorganisms will not be destroyed and will still be metabolically active and viable if transferred to favorable conditions. As estimates of the infection dose of some pathogenic microorganisms are very low, growth of these microorganisms in foods is not necessary to cause infection

To qualify as an alternative method, a new technology should have significant impact on quality while at the same time maintain the cost of technology within feasibility limits. In recent years, several technologies have been investigated that have the capability of inactivating microorganisms at lower temperatures than typically used in conventional heat treatments.

Application of pulsed electric fields of high intensity and duration from microseconds to milliseconds may cause temporary or permanent permeabilization of cell membranes. The effects of PEF on biomembranes have been thoroughly studied since the use of PEF has attracted great interest in several scientific areas such as cell biology, biotechnology, medicine, or food technology.

Pulsed Electric Fields for Food Processing Technology"
12720,1,"I was wondering if any of you could humor a question I have regarding the preservation of raw salmon eggs at room temperature. 

I am interested in making Chinook Salmon eggs, or roe, shelf stable through pasteurization, vacuum sealed in mason jars at 70 degrees Celsius for 90 minutes. Any higher temperature or duration seems to have negative effect on color and consistency of the egg. 

So far I have gotten them to maintain a shelf-life of nearly two weeks at room temperature. I would like to extend that to 1 year or greater. 

I cannot change the consistency or color of the egg as they are used for fishing, not for human consumption. They can't have their scent adulterated, either. Whatever additive I can add to the jar doesn't have to be food safe but they can't have any smells or flavors as the fish they're being used for can smell parts per million. 

The egg must come out of the sealed jar after, say 6 months, not dissimilar to the way they entered regarding scent, color, and consistency. 

I can't use alcohol because they change the scent and dehydrate the egg membrane. I can't use iodine because it's yellow and smells. I understand thay most food preservatives, such as potassium sorbate, is mostly effective against yeast, less so for bacteria. I can't boil them because it changes the egg. 

I'm not a food scientist (read:I'm not a scientist) and don't know where to go from here. I've done extensive Googling and am getting nowhere. 

I have considered dehydration but haven't tried. I'm concerned the membrane will be damaged in the process. The issue with damaging the membrane is that they ""milk"" quickly. Meaning that they go from bright orange to white. Fresh eggs make it about 45 minutes to  1 hour. That's the target. Freezing them damages the membrane from crystallization and they milk faster. Like milking after 10 to 20 minutes. They're useless after being fully milked and have to be changed. I've found that if I freeze them in a cryogenic fashion and thaw them slowly in the fridge, they milk normally. However, I can't recreate that on a large scale nor sell on bait store shelves whilst frozen. But it's a cool discovery anyway. 

So I went down the road of UVC exposure and was mere moments from buying the equipment to tumble jars of spawn (roe) under a light system when I came across the little cumbersome fact that the glass of the jars will absorb 100% of the UVC radiation and the eggs will never be exposed. So I quit there. 

I've thought about tumbling them under UV light but I figure it would have to be in a clean environment otherwise they'll just be contaminated via airborne pathogens on their way to their jars before sealing. I'm also not interested in making a laminar flow hood large enough to make the light machine and have enough space to jar them. It's just not practical. 

So this is when I turned to a chemical option. Where I also struck out.

I understand if you're not interested in giving your two-cents but if you are... I'd really really appreciate it."

Kitchen sponges are among the possible sources of contaminants in food establishments. The main purpose of the current study was, therefore, to assess the microbiological safety of sponges as it has been used in selected food establishments of Jimma town. 

Accordingly, the microbiological safety of a total of 201 kitchen sponges randomly collected from food establishments was evaluated against the total counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and molds. The mean counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged from 7.43 to 12.44 log CFU/mm3. The isolated genera were dominated by  *Pseudomonas* (16.9%),  *Bacillus*  (11.1%),  *Micrococcus*  (10.6%),  *Streptococcus*  (7.8%), and  *Lactobacillus*  (6%) excluding the unidentified Gram positive rods (4.9%) and Gram negative rods (9.9%). 

The high microbial counts (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, and yeast and molds) reveal the existence of poor kitchen sponge sanitization practice. Awareness creation training on basic hygienic practices to food handlers and periodic change of kitchen sponges are recommended.

**Although**   **most kinds of**   ***E. coli***   **are harmless, some can make you sick. Learn about the kinds of**  ***E. coli*  that cause diarrhea,**   **and what you can do to help lower your chances of infection.**

### What are  *Escherichia coli* ?

*Escherichia coli* (abbreviated  *E. coli* ) are bacteria found in the intestines of people and animals and in the environment; they can also be found in foods.

Most  *E. coli*  are harmless and are part of a healthy intestinal tract. However, some cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, bloodstream infections, and other illnesses. The types of  *E. coli*  that can cause illness are spread through contaminated food or water and through contact with animals or people.

Two types of  *E. coli*  that cause diarrheal illness diagnosed in the United States are Shiga toxin-producing  *E. coli*  (STEC) and enterotoxigenic  *E. coli*  (ETEC).

STEC are a group of  *E. coli*  that produce Shiga toxin. This toxin causes people to have diarrhea, which can be bloody. When you hear reports about outbreaks of  *E. coli*  infections in the United States, they’re usually talking about a type called STEC O157.

ETEC are the leading cause of traveler’s diarrhea and a major cause of diarrhea around the world, especially among children.

### Who is more likely to get an  *E. coli*  infection?

Anyone can get sick from harmful  *E. coli* , but some people have an increased chance of infection. These people are:

* Children younger than 5 years of age
* Adults aged 65 and older
* People with weakened immune systems, including pregnant women
* People who travel to certain countries

### What are the symptoms of  *E. coli*  infections?

**STEC** : Most people have bloody diarrhea and stomach cramps that may be severe. Some people may also have vomiting. A high fever is uncommon. Symptoms usually last 5–7 days.

**ETEC** : Most people have stomach cramps and watery diarrhea. Symptoms usually last 3–4 days.

**Contact your healthcare provider**  if you have diarrhea or vomiting that lasts for more than 2 days, bloody stools, a fever higher than 102˚F, or signs of dehydration (including little or no urination, excessive thirst, a very dry mouth, dizziness or lightheadedness, or very dark urine).

Most people with an  *E. coli*  infection will recover without any specific treatment. Whether your doctor prescribes antibiotics depends on several factors, including the kind of  *E. coli*  infection you have and the severity of your infection.

Antibiotics should not be used to treat STEC infection. Taking certain antibiotics may lead to the production or release of more Shiga toxin, which can increase the chance of kidney damage.

### How can I prevent  *E. coli*  infection?

* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and running water.
* Follow the four steps to food safety when preparing food: clean, separate, cook, and chill.
* Use a food thermometer to make sure meat has reached a safe minimum cooking temperature

  * Cook ground beef, pork, and lamb to an internal temperature of at least 160°F (70˚C).
  * Insert food thermometer into the side of the patty, to the center, to check.
  * Cook beef steaks and roasts to an internal temperature of at least 145°F (62.6˚C) and allow to rest for 3 minutes after you remove meat from the grill or stove.
  * Check temperature in the thickest part of steaks or roasts.
* Prevent cross-contamination by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils with soap and water after they touch raw meat.
* Do not drink untreated water or swallow water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard “kiddie” pools.
* Don’t eat raw dough or batter.
* Drink pasteurized milk and juices.
* Take precautions with food and water when.

### How can I prevent E. coli infection from animals?

* Play it safe around animals, including those at petting zoos, farms, fairs, and even your backyard.
  * Wash your hands often
  * Eat and drink safely
* Keep food and drinks out of animal areas
  * Keep children safe around animals
 * Children  **always**  need adult supervision around animals.

Then I increased the water amount to x + t and also increased the temperature to y + s, and ideally, given the fact that caffeine is an endothermic reaction and also that none of the water parameters changed, the dissolution should have been easier, but it became difficult to dissolve.

Good afternoon, and hope you are well. I have an exciting new food science resource to share with you. A bit of background:

The Good Food Institute is a non-profit that advances plant-based, fermentation-derived and cultivated (grown from cells) meat, eggs, dairy and seafood. We work with scientists, policymakers and entrepreneurs to create open-access resources, publish scientific research, help established food companies to expand into alternative proteins, and facilitate access to R&D funds.

We have recently launched a global [Collaborative Research Directory](https://www.gfi.org/collaborate) which makes it easier for researchers like you to find collaborators with complementary skills so that together you can accelerate the transition to the next generation of meat, eggs, dairy and seafood.

In this directory, you’ll find researchers who are already active in the alternative protein space and those who want to begin applying their expertise to this field. It also indicates what kinds of collaboration opportunities the researchers are interested in exploring with students, labs, and companies. Everyone in this directory has agreed to be contacted by other researchers, though no commitments are implied. 

You may also want to check out the many resources we build for scientists, including our scientific research database, competitive research grant programme, and research funding database. And keep an eye on our social media channels in the coming weeks for an exciting opportunity to join our team in Europe: www.linkedin.com/company/gfi-europe

If you’re working in this space, we’d love you to get involved and signed up to the Collaborative Research Directory. If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.

Many thanks, and very best wishes,

Successful sucrose replacement in cake systems requires thorough understanding of its functionality.

Time-domain H NMR showed that water in the viscous aqueous phase isolated from cake batter by ultracentrifugation [i.e. the batter liquor (BL)] exhibits low
mobility by its low T2 relaxation time (T2,D RT). This is due to its interactions with sucrose or sucrose replacers.

The T2,D RT itself is positively related with the effective volumetric hydrogen bond density of sucrose or sucrose replacers. Sucrose additionally codetermines the quantity and viscosity of cake BL and thereby how much air the batter contains at the end of mixing. Like sucrose, maltitol and oligofructose provide adequate volumes of BL with low water mobility and thus sufficient air in the batter, while the rather insoluble mannitol and inulin do not.

Differential scanning calorimetry and rapid viscosity analysis revealed, however, that, in contrast to sucrose and maltitol, oligofructose fails to provide appropriate timings of starch gelatinisation and protein denaturation, resulting in poor cake texture. The shortcomings of mannitol and oligofructose in terms of respectively ensuring appropriate gas content in batter and biopolymer transitions during baking can be overcome by using mixtures thereof. This work shows that successful sucrose substitutes or substitute mixtures must provide sufficient BL with low water mobility and ensure appropriate timings of starch and protein biopolymer transitions during baking.

10001,1,"Food Additives as Flavor Enhancers- FAs as FEs

![](upload://8LIZnlKIakK2FlEVV6XH60MWdFs.jpeg)

FOOD ADDITIVES

Food additives are substances which are natural or man-made (i.e synthetic) to produce specific effects when added to food. These substances improve the sensory activities of the food when added.

WHAT ARE FLAVOR ENHANCERS?

Flavor enhancers are food additives that are used in savory foods (like bread, meat, peanuts e.t.c) which are added to the flavor of the food or improve its flavor. These enhancers on their own do not have effective taste or flavor, but when they are added to foods, they helps to either supplement the flavor of the food or enhance it(that means they makes the flavor of the food effective). Salt is also a flavor enhancer that preserves the food (like soups, locust beans, broths e.t.c). Sweeteners like Aspartame and AcesulfameK also used as flavor enhancer to enhance the flavor of desserts and chewing gum. Flavor enhancer

Glutamic acid and its salts are the common flavor enhancers. This acid contains amino acids and they are found in both in protein of plant and animal (fish, milk, cheese, peanuts e.t.c).

Monosodium Glutamate, which is also called MSG (one of the glutamic acid salts, which is one of the chief flavor enhancers), has shown unfavorable attention due to Chinese restaurant syndrome (which is an allergy reaction when some people eat Chinese food). Symptoms are: chest pain, headache e.t.c.

MSG continues to be used in some foods because many studies have been unsuccessful by not proving how the syndrome is related to MSG.

NATURAL FLAVOR ENHANCERS

Natural flavor enhancers are enhancers that rise the state at which food is being stable. The natural flavor enhancer which is used in increasing the biological effect of calcium in milk is StabilEase.

E620 GLUTAMIC acid

Sources

Glutamic acid as said above is an amino acid found in abundance in both plant and animal protein. In humans it is a non-essential amino acid, i.e., the body is capable of producing its own glutamic acid, and is not dependent upon getting glutamic acid from ingested food. Tomatoes, seaweed and starch are rich sources of glutamic acid. One of the glutamic acid salts, monosodium glutamate MSG is the only one used to any significant extent in food industry.

Synthesizing MSG:

 MSG is made by bacterial fermentation, usually starting from starch or molasses.

 The product of fermentation is separated by filtration,

 And neutralized with an alkaline sodium salt such as sodium hydroxide.

• Glutamic acid salts:

 E621 Monosodium glutamate

 E622 Monopotassium glutamate

 E623 Calcium diglutamate

 E624 Monoammonium glutamate

 E625 Magnesium diglutamate

These are commonly referred to in the industry as glutamate.

Function in Food:

 Glutamate is used to develop and enhance the flavor of, mainly, savory products.

 It also has its own characteristic flavor, which is considered by some people to be a fifth basic taste, “umami”, in addition to the original four of sweet, salt, sour and bitter.

Umami is a Japanese word that means pleasant taste.

Limitations:

• The glutamates are permitted in Directive in foods in general to a maximum of 10g/kg.

• Some exceptional foods, Parmesan cheese for example, naturally contain glutamate higher than this limit.

• They are also permitted in seasonings and condiments. But we have to take into consideration that the taste of MSG has a self-limiting characteristic. Once the correct amount has been used, any additional quantity leads to a decrease in palatability.

Typical products are soups, sauces, prepared meals and sausages.

COMMON FOOD ENHANCERS:

E621 Monosodium glutamate, MSG

Monosodium glutamate, MSG as already said is one of the chief flavor enhancers that are used as a flavor in protein rich food. This food flavor enhancer increases the taste of umami in protein rich food such as fish, meat and milk. This food enhancer increases the food flavor, which is very good for the people who do not enjoy eating. If the food manufacturers are using this enhancer then he or she must put this in the category of labeled items as per the regulation of the United States Food and Drug Administration. Allergies in some consumers are caused due to intake of MSG. So you must be aware of the fact whether you are allergic to Monosodium glutamate or not. Monosodium glutamate is traded under the name Ajinomoto, Vetsin, and Accent.

E622 Monopotassium glutamate

Monopotassium glutamate is a potassium and acid salt of glutamic acid. It is one of the non-sodium food flavor enhancers.

E623 Calcium diglutamate

This flavor enhancer is also called calcium glutamate or CDG. Apart from its use as flavor enhancer, CDG is also used as a first-aid treatment for hydrofluoric acid.

E626 Guanylic acid

This food flavor enhancer is also called Guanosine monophosphate or 5'- guanidylic acid. It also enhances the umami taste like MSG. It is one of the quiet expensive flavor enhancers.

E627 Disodium guanylate, sodium guanylate

Disodium guanylate, is also called sodium 5'-guanylate and disodium 5'-guanylate and also very expensive. It is obtained from dried fish or dried seaweed and used in instant noodles, snacks, potato chips, cured meat, packaged soups and thinned vegetables.

E630 Inosinic acid: Inosinic acid as a food flavor enhancer is very important for the proper metabolism of the body. It is degraded to uric acid in the human body, therefore, the storage of uric acid may occur, which may be problematic in the case of already-existent pathology with regard to uric acid, such as gout. No evidence of adverse effects or carcinogenicity on reproduction. The food industry uses inosinic acid and its salt as flavor enhancers. It occurs naturally in muscle tissue and arises as a product of the decomposition of meat.

E631 Disodium inosinate:

Disodium inosinate (E631) is the disodium salt of inosinic acid. It is used as a food additive.

Disodium inosinate is used as a flavor enhancer, in synergy with monosodium glutamate (MSG) to provide the umami taste. Combination of disodium inosinate in food with other flavor enhancer known as disodium guanylate is known as disodium 5-ribonucleotides [E635]. As a relatively expensive product, disodium inosinate is usually not used independently of glutamic acid; if disodium inosinate is present in a list of ingredients, but MSG does not appear to be, it is possible that glutamic acid is naturally occurring in another ingredient like tomatoes. Disodium inosinate is often found in: Potato chips, Instant noodles and a variety of other snacks. Disodium inosinate may not be suitable for vegetarians because it is generally produced from meat or from fish, and in most cases not suitable for Jews and Muslims, depending on the origin of the products.

OTHER FLAVOR ENHANCERS ARE:

E624 Monoammonium glutamate

E625 Magnesium diglutamate

E628 Dipotassium guanylate

E629 Calcium guanylate

E632 Dipotassium inosinate

E633 Calcium inosinate

E634 Calcium 5'-ribonucleotides

E635 Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides

E636 Maltol

E637 Ethyl maltol

E640 Glycine and its sodium salt

There are many reasons that food can spoil. These are six common causes:
*🦠Microorganisms* - bacteria, yeasts, moulds and fungi can grow in food and affect the appearance, odour, taste and texture. They require time and optimum temperatures to grow and reproduce. Pathogenic microorganisms, that cause food borne illness, may grow in foods without any noticeable changes. Many food preservation methods act to remove, kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms
*💧Enzymes*- naturally present in foods, such as fruit and vegetables, are responsible for the ripening process and can impact colour, texture and flavour (e.g. colour change of bananas from yellow to brown; apples browning once cut)
*🌀Oxidation* - occurs when food interacts with air, resulting in undesirable changes in colour, flavour and nutritional content. It also causes rancidity in fats
*☀️Light* - can cause colour and vitamin losses and contribute to the oxidation of fats
*💥Physical damage* - bruises and cracks on raw produce, and damaged or poorly sealed packaging, can allow microorganisms, air and pests to enter
*🦗 Pests* - insects, rodents and parasites can damage food, making it vulnerable to further deterioration. They can also carry microorganisms and cause physical contamination"

**Implementation of Food Safety Management Systems along with Other Management Tools (HAZOP, FMEA, Ishikawa, Pareto). 
The Case Study of Listeria monocytogenes and Correlation with Microbiological Criteria**

**Abstract**

The food industry’s failure in planning and designing of and in implementing a Food Safety
Management System and its foundation elements leads, in most instances, to compromised food
safety and subsequent foodborne illness outbreaks. This phenomenon was noticed, worldwide, for all food processors, but with a much higher incidence in the medium- and small-sized food processing plants. 

Our study focuses on the importance of Food Safety Management System (FSMS), Critical
Control Points Hazard Analysis (HACCP) and the Prerequisite Programs (PRPs) as the foundation
of HACCP, in preventing foodborne outbreaks. For emphasis, we make use of the example of
organizational food safety culture failures and the lack of managerial engagement which resulted in a multi-state listeriosis outbreak in USA. Moreover, we correlate this with microbiological criteria.
Implementation of food safety management systems (ISO 22000:2018) along with incorporation of management tools such as HAZOP, FMEA, Ishikawa and Pareto have proved to be proactive in the maintenance of a positive food safety culture and prevention of cross-contamination and fraud.

Essential oils are the volatile compounds having the oily fragrance. Essential oils are obtained from the different plant parts, and they are extracted from the different techniques and the most preferable method of extraction is the hydrodistillation which is cheap and easy to use.

Plant parts including the flowers, leaves, stem, bark and roots are used for the isolation of essential oils. Essential oils are used in almost every field of life and because of these characteristics, the market of essential oils is growing rapidly. 

Essential oils are used in the aromatherapy and act as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, pain relievers, anxiety, depression. In the field of cosmetics and industries, the essential oils are used rapidly and mostly used in the perfume industries which are growing increasingly. Essential oils are used in the food preservations and many food items. 

Essential oils are used as the folk herbal medicines and their fragrance is used for the improvement of the mood and as the depression release.

Dr Andreas Klieber – Managing Director QAPartners

![|300x200](upload://2dOqyStjjHbShVjMJ4bDfdOSe5H.jpeg)

The current Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) crisis is heavily focused on medical intervention, and rightly so. Containing the outbreak and preventing further spread is the highest priority. It should also be noted that there are still many unknowns about this virus.

There are, however, also some things known by now including that it may transmit from human to human before symptoms occur, that it is largely genetically similar to the SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) and that it may survive in human faecal matter.

From a food safety point of view, this leads to a number of considerations regarding the potential risks to raw materials and foods associated with the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

1. The survival of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in human specimens is still being researched, but it appears to survive in faecal samples. Research on SARS-CoV indicates that this virus is relatively hardy and survives in serum, sputum and faeces for at least 96 hours. In urine, it could remain alive at least 72 hours with a low level of infectivity. (Duan et al., Stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and environment and its sensitivity to heating and UV irradiation. (Biomed Environ Sci. 2003 Sep;16(3):246-55.)

2. Therefore, excellent personal hygiene practices are required to limit the risks of food and raw materials to human pathogens including viruses. This is extensively addressed in modern food safety systems and includes focus on handwashing, suitable toileting facilities, personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusion of food handlers with symptoms of illness including sore throats, coughs and fever, return to work sign off by a qualified doctor and so on.

3. If alcohol-based sanitisers are used following hand washing, ‘ethanol, the most common alcohol ingredient, appears to be the most effective against viruses’, with 95% ethanol being more effective than 80% for hardy viruses such as Hepatitis A. WHO formulations I and II (ethanol-based and isopropanol-based respectively) were effective against SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). (Gold N.A. and Usha A., Alcohol Sanitizer, updated December 16, 2019, accessed 3/02/2020)

4. Research on SARS-CoV showed that these viruses stayed stable at 4 °C and at room temperature (20 °C) for at least 2 hours on a range of surfaces and in water. (Duan et al., Stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and environment and its sensitivity to heating and UV irradiation. (Biomed Environ Sci. 2003 Sep; 16(3):246-55.)

5. SARS-CoV were inactivated by heat treatments of 90 minutes at 56 °C, 60 minutes at 67 °C or 30 minutes 75 °C. UV irradiation for 60 min of the virus in culture inactivated it. (Duan et al., Stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and environment and its sensitivity to heating and UV irradiation. (Biomed Environ Sci. 2003 Sep; 16(3):246-55.)

The data points at some food industries that may be more exposed to this threat than others. Any foods that are not cooked to a significant degree are more at risk; this is even the case for foods processed with a ‘ *Listeria* -cook’ of 72 °C for 2 minutes. Also, chilling and most likely freezing is not readily going to destroy this virus and therefore chilled and frozen foods sourced from major outbreak zones should be risk assessed.

The above information gives us an indication of how Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) may behave in human hosts and the environment and specific interventions that could be taken. Much of these are already considered and implemented in modern food safety systems.

However, if you would like a professional review of your food safety systems in light of this emerging issue, QAPartners can assist you through an independent, confidential review of your business’ preparedness.

2887,1,"EDIBLE WATER BOTTLE	
Food is an inevitable part of humans’ life. So, globally food processing industries are the fastest growing industries. Also, we have to consider that it consumes most of the plastic as food packing material and for other purposes So, food technologists, food engineers and those who are concerned with food and environment try to find alternatives for plastics. 

Recently, our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi banned one-time use plastics. This is a huge step towards environmental conservation.

Plastic is unsustainable material and the use of a huge amount of plastic in most of every field increases the burden on the environment as it cannot degrade in the environment. So that it is the mutual responsibility of every human to reduce the usage of plastic and increase the use of biodegradable materials if possible. So nowadays, food industries and restaurants are replacing plastics with biodegradable, edible and multilayer packaging materials. Also, researchers and scientists are continuously trying towards the development of an alternative to plastics and also try to find bacteria or such a solution by which plastic can degrade. 
Here I want to emphasize on the water that packed in PET bottles. As we all knew that water is a basic necessity for every living entity including humans. As to some extent, plastic is harmful to our health,
scientist and researches found alternatives for the PET water bottle. They found edible water ball. So that we can eat water instead of drinking. This is novel concept for water as food and also reduce usage of plastic and also we get pure water. 

The formulation of edible water ball is easy as water is enclosed in a genius membrane made from seaweed algae extract which is sustainable and biodegradable. Here membrane works as a protective outer covering for water and this membrane is edible. 

In the seaweed membrane, any liquid can be filled and any color or dye can be used. This product has two benefits: one is you can have pure water and another it is biodegradable within few weeks so it’s environmental friendly. 

Researchers and scientists are still working on this new idea and it will take some time to come to the markets for commercialization."

💧 BET Equation shows considerable success especially for dehydrated food products
💧 BET has a good fit for a linear model at water activity range of 0.05 - 0.50
💧 The equation has two variables, monolayer value (Mo) and the heat of sorption

E1200, as the European Union calls it, is a synthetic polymer formed by crosslinking a large number of glucose molecules. 

Tasteless, odorless, white-cream colored, granular powder form polydextrose is perfectly soluble in water. 

Dr. The use of [polydextrose](https://feople.io/t/what-is-polydextrose/2522) as a food additive discovered by Hans Renhard in 1965 was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1981. Glucose obtained from corn starch is used as raw material in the production of commercial polydextrose. Polydextrose is obtained by polymerizing at high temperature in the presence of glucose sorbitol and citric acid.

The mixture contains 89 parts of glucose versus 10 parts of sorbitol as plasticizer and 1 part of citric acid as catalyst. The polydextrose obtained by crosslinking the glucose molecules is subjected to a series of purification processes and is made commercially available. The final product may contain a small amount of sorbitol and citric acid.


Polydextrose, which has the feature of soluble dietary fiber, provides saturation, helps to regulate blood sugar level and maintain weight. The polydextrose, which is used as a sugar, starch or fat substitute, especially in the production of low-calorie foodstuffs, provides 1 kcal energy when consumed. 

Polydextrose used as filler in the production of various foods, especially low-calorie products; it is also included in the formulation with properties such as thickening, moisture-retaining and improving mouth feel.

In the production of low calorie bakery products such as bread, pizza dough, crackers, lavash, polydextrose is included in the formulation to provide desired mouth sensation and texture properties while substituting sugar and starch. Polydextrose also contributes to prolong the shelf life of these products with its moisture-retaining feature.

The polydextrose added to carbonated or non-carbonated beverages to replace sugar or to increase the amount of dietary fiber acts as a filler to provide the desired product structure. It also improves the mouth feel by making the polydextrose product feel more oily in low-fat milk drinks.

The polydextrose included in the low-calorie chocolate formulation helps maintain the creamy structure of the product and contributes to the flavor with its mild caramel flavor.

Dietary fiber-enriched pasta and noodles are used to produce polydextrose. Polydextrose improves the mechanical properties of the dough during processing, allowing the product to take the desired shape and maintain.

Polydextrose contributes to the oral sensation, fullness and textural properties of sugar, which is substituted with synthetic or natural sweeteners, which are used in the production of various foods and give intense sweetness."

 a. The dose-response relationship is investigated by slowly reducing the dose. At each dose; absorption, metabolism and excretion of the additive.

 b. Carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and allergic effects of experimental animals are investigated.

2.If a dose cannot be found in which the additive has no effect, it is not allowed to be added to the food.

3.Determine NOAEL (concentration at which no effect is observed). With the dose of NOAEL found, daily dose amounts of carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and allergic effects in various organs of their bodies are determined as milligrams per kilogram of animal weight to cover 85% of the life span of the experimental animals. Since the experiment cannot be performed on people for ethical reasons, a safety factor is used. In other words, 1/100 of the dose which shows no effect in the experimental animal is accepted for human. ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) = NOAEL / 100. The ADI value is determined in milligrams per kilogram of human body weight. Maximum daily intake = ADI x Body weight.

4.The second step in determining the maximum amount of additive to be added to the food is to determine the quantity required by the production technology of the food (GMP = Suitable Production Technology) within the framework of ADI. If the GMP amount and ADI value are exceeded, the use of the additive is not permitted."

In this study, the reduction of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) levels during lab-scale  *ergo*  production was investigated through determination of the residual levels of AFM1 using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. 

The results showed gradual and incubation time dependent reduction of AFM1 level in the raw milk samples being fermented to  *ergo* . The maximum reductions of 57.33 and 54.04% were recorded in AFM1 in natural and LAB inoculums initiated fermentations, respectively, in 5 days of incubation. 

Although a significant difference (*P=0.05*) in the AFM1 decrease in the two types of fermentations was recorded, such findings could vary with milk samples depending on initial load of the microorganisms as determined by hygienic conditions. However, the level of AFM1 in control (sterilized) samples showed only a 5.5% decrease during the entire period of incubation. Microbiological investigation showed increasing LAB counts with incubation time. A gradual decrease in pH of the milk samples was observed during fermentation. 

Considering the fact that both viable and dead bacterial cells could remove AFM1 during  *ergo*  production, the mechanism is proposed as predominantly involving noncovalent binding of the toxin with the chemical components of the bacterial cell wall.

E322 Lecithin is an emulsion obtained from soybean, egg yolk, peanut, corn or animal sources. Emulsifiers prevent oil from separating from the water phase. . It is not toxic but overdose disrupts the stomach, cuts the appetite and causes sweating. margarine, chocolate, mayonnaise and milk powder is used to provide the composition of oils. Herbal type should be preferred.

Lecithin is also called phosphatidylcholine. Lecithin is produced as a by-product during the production of flour from soybean sprouts or during the production of soybean oil from soybean plants and contains glaucolipids, triglycerides and phospholipids. Phospholipids are the building blocks in the cell membrane that all cells in the body need. Phospholipids prevent cell membrane hardening. Lecithin protects cells against oxidation and acts as the protective membrane surrounding the brain in humans.

Lecithin is also sold in the form of soft gelatin capsules or granular powders and is consumed for various health reasons because it is believed to lower cholesterol, strengthen memory, improve liver function among the population. The effect of lecithin in lowering cholesterol in humans was investigated. However, in a review published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1989, examining the results of 24 studies, there was little evidence that lecithin directly reduces cholesterol (Knuiman et al., 1989).

There are also studies on the effects of lecithin on memory functions. There is no certainty that lecithin improves memory, because inconsistencies have been observed in human studies. Other potential benefits of lecithin are its role in liver and reproductive health, as well as in improving physical performance in certain activities. Further research is needed to confirm these health effects of lecithin."

Pectin hydrogels have garnered significant attention in the food industry due to their re markable versatility and promising properties. 

As a naturally occurring polysaccharide, pectin forms three-dimensional (3D) hydrophilic polymer networks, endowing these hydrogels with softness, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Their exceptional attributes surpass those of other biopolymer gels, exhibiting rapid gelation, higher melting points, and efficient carrier capabilities for flavoring and fat barriers. 

This review provides an overview of the current state of pectin gelling mechanisms and the classification of hydrogels, as well as their crosslinking types, as investigated through diverse research endeavors worldwide. The preparation of pectin hydrogels is categorized into specific gel types, including hydrogels, cryogels, aerogels, xerogels, and oleogels. 

Each preparation process is thoroughly discussed, shedding light on how it impacts the properties of pectin gels. 

Furthermore, the review delves into the various crosslinking methods used to form hydrogels, with a focus on physical, chemical, and interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) approaches. Understanding these crosslinking mechanisms is crucial to harnessing the full potential of pectin hydrogels for food-related applications. 

The review aims to provide valuable insights into the diverse applications of pectin hydrogels in the food industry, motivating further exploration to cater to consumer demands andadvance food technology. By exploiting the unique properties of pectin hydrogels, food formulations can be enhanced with encapsulated bioactive substances, improved stability, and controlled release. Additionally, the exploration of different crosslinking methods expands the horizons of potential applications.

**Abstract**

Cashew is a highly nutritive fruit native to Brazil, but the high astringency of its integral juice limits its acceptability and consumption. Using tangential microfiltration process it is already possible to reduce up to 97% of the tannin present in the cashew juice.

Making use of this same technology, the present work studied the changes in the volatile composition caused by this process, monitored by sensory evaluation. Cashew juice was obtained from the processing of cashew apples in an expeller extractor.


The juice was clarified in a microfiltration pilot scale plant. Volatile compounds were extracted through vacuum evaporation, trapped into a polymer membrane and analyzed by GCMS. Difference-from-control sensory test was applied to verify aroma sensitive changes between the integral and clarified juice.

Cashew juice clarification by tangential microfiltration provoked a few alterations on the juice’s volatile profile, but these changes did not impair the characteristic cashew aroma in the clarified juice.

Many foods are very sensitive for oxygen, which is responsible for the deterioration of many products either directly or indirectly. In fact, in many cases food deterioration is caused by oxidation reactions or by the presence of spoilage aerobic microorganisms. Therefore, in order to preserve these products, oxygen is often excluded.

Oxygen (O2) presence in food packages is mainly due to failures in the packaging process, such as mixture of gases containing oxygen residues, or inefficient vacuum. Vacuum packaging has been widely used to eliminate oxygen in the package prior to sealing. However, the oxygen that permeates from the outside environment into the package through the packaging material cannot be removed by this method .

Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is often used as an alternative to reduce the O2 inside food packaging. However, for many foods, the levels of residual oxygen that can be achieved by regular (MAP) technologies are too high for maintaining the desired quality and for achieving the sought shelf-life . The use of oxygen scavenging packaging materials means that oxygen dissolved in the food, or present initially in the headspace, can potentially be reduced to levels much lower than those achievable by modified atmosphere packaging .

In this context, research and developments in the food packaging area have been conducted, aiming to eliminate residual O2. One of the most attractive subjects is the active packaging concept. Active packaging includes oxygen and ethylene scavengers, carbon dioxide scavengers and emitters, humidity controllers, flavor emitters or absorbers and films incorporated with antimicrobial and antioxidant agents .

The most used active packaging technologies for food are those developed to scavenge oxygen and were first commercialized in the late 1970s by Japan’s Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company (Ageless®). In the case of gas scavengers, reactive compounds are either contained in individual sachets or stickers associated to the packaging material or directly incorporated into the packaging material .

The first patent of an absorber was given in 1938 in Finland. This patent was developed to remove the residual oxygen in headspace of metallic packaging. The method of introduction of hydrogen gas in the packaging to react with oxygen in palladium presence was commercialized in 1960s however this method has never been popularized and well accepted because the hydrogen was unstable during manipulation and storage and, furthermore, it is expensive and unwholesome . Recently, more than 400 patents were recorded, mainly in EUA, Japan and Europe, due the great interest by absorbers use .

Oxygen scavengers are becoming increasingly attractive to food manufacturers and retailers and the growth outlook for the global market is bullish. Pira International Ltd estimated the global oxygen scavenger market to be 12 billion units in Japan, 500 million in the USA and 300 million in Western Europe in 2001. This market was forecast to grow to 14.4 billion in Japan, 4.5 billion in the USA and 5.7 billion in Western Europe in 2007 . In addition, Pira International Ltd. estimated the global value of this market in 2005 to be worth $588 million and has forecast this market to be worth $924 million in 2010. The increasing popularity of oxygen scavenging polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, bottle caps and crowns for beers and other beverages has greatly contributed to this impressive growth .

 The product is a kind of powdered dietary supplement for adults (low protein formula powder), main composition (up to 85%) was oil powder and maltodextrin. I have mixed all the powdered ingredients in lab (in a clear food plastic bag, tied it and left aside). 

In within two hours, some dark brown colored crystals/solids were found. As I removed the micronutrients premix powder (MNP) from the formula list, the rest of the powder looked fine and no crystal was formed. 

I believe that the problem could be caused by the MNP premix powder, but I have no idea what could cause the problem, and I could find any answers through the internet. 

Did anyone experienced similar issues, or anyone knew which kind of the micronutrients could cause crystallization to carbohydrates, protein or oil powder? (All the ingredients are in solid form)

Hi all,

In fact this is general chemistry question. But i think answers also can help food professionals.

Question is that;

When a solid is dissolved in a liquid, **which size are the dissolved solids in solution**? Nanometer, some of micrometer or both?

Sucrose molecule size is *a*  = 1.08631 nm,  *b*  = 0.87044 nm,  *c*  = 0.77624 nm

so when sucrose is dissolved in water all molecules are alone or some of them can be together?
*I think all molecules are not alone.*

Hello guys,

Just found this forum in google.
I have been trying to extend the shelf life of fresh alkaline wheat noodle / Asian noodle.  
I know there are so many factors to extend the shelf life especially hygiene. Let me tell what I did so far. 
1. The drinking water was sterilized using ozone gas.
2. The utensil and machine was cleaned before hand using cleaning agent.
3. I am using Potassium Sorbate in the recipe 
4. The product packed with Modified Atmospheric Packaging / MAP method consist of CO2+N2 gas
5. I put oxygen absorber just in case. 

With all of this, I was able to extend the noodle to 7 days under room temperature condition.  No odor, no mold, no significant color discoloration.

I am thinking to step up further to 1 months. I believe to achieve this I need some way to pasteurized the fresh noodle. Reducing moisture is way to go, but I don't want to make it bone dry. I want to keep it about 20% moisture so it become semi-dry noodle.
is there any insight to do it so?  

Thank in advance"

I am doing research on a **non-bake cheesecake** made from the premix powder (mix with cold water or milk to to make the batter, then set in the freezer). The requirement is that the quality of cake stored in the freezer in one month has to be stable (We can put the cake out of the freezer and put in the fridge to thaw before serving). The problem is that after being stored in the freezer (-16oC) in 1 week, the cake after being thawed in the fridge has the undesired quality: less smooth, less compact, a little water on the surface of the cake. This situation is more severe when storage time in the freezer is increased  (more ice crystal, the cake is drier and drier, gritty mouthfeel appears). I try to use some hydrocolloids (CMC, xanthan), gelling agents (pregeled-modified starch and gelatin) in the formula, but it doesn't work well. Can you please give me some advice on using other stabilizers (note that it must be active in cold water because this is non-bake cheesecake).
Thank you very much!"

1627,1,"Hello.  I'm new, and signed up just to see if anyone can answer this question, but I do love food science, and used to watch Alton Brown's show on Food channel religiously.

So.. the question, which requires a little explanation.  I make something I call Pizza Eggs.  Pretty simple.  Beat a few eggs together, heat some chopped pepperoni (Hormel slices) in a skillet until it starts to sweat out some of the oils, add a little butter/olive oil and then the eggs. Scramble, adding salt, pepper, whatever I'm in the mood for, which usually involves garlic and always involves cheese.  Just before you remove it from the pan, add pizza sauce or tomato sauce, whatever I have on hand.

If I add the tomato sauce a little too early, the flavor changes entirely, and it is NOT a good thing.  The only way I can describe it is 'gritty', though it's not really a texture.  You have to add it early enough to warm it to the temperature of the eggs, at least, so it's a little touchy.  I usually take them off the heat when they're a still a little wet, and add the tomato sauce just as they're completely set.  It cools them just enough to prevent overcooking, but sometimes cools them too much, and reheating gives the same result as adding the sauce too early.  Nasty taste.

So why does the flavor change if I add the tomato sauce too early?  I get that it has to be something that happens to the tomato sauce or the combination of egg and sauce above a specific temperature, but I have no idea what it could be.  I haven't tried homemade fresh sauce, so I don't even know if it's something in the processing, but I do know the acid in tomatoes changes things as they're cooked, so I suspect it's related.  Maybe preheating the sauce would help?  I haven't tried it.

If you know what's happening to my poor eggs, please let me know.  And thanks!"

2597,1,"Nowadays, there is no immediate consumption of the products produced. Foods should have a long shelf life and be kept safe until they reach the consumer. Various packaging materials can be used for food preservation. Eler The materials used in the packaging of foods are mainly paper, metal, glass and plastic. No food packaging is completely inert and migration can occur. Migrant migration from glass, metal, plastic, rubber, ceramic and paper packages to food is possible in contact with certain foodstuffs. Migration analysis detects toxic substances from packaging to food. Migration practices are divided into two:

1. The Total Migration Limit (TML) is the maximum allowable amount of non-volatile substances that pass from the substance or material to the food analogue.

2. The Specific Migration Limit (SML) is the maximum allowable amount of a particular substance that passes from the substance or material to the food or food similar.

Diffuse substances can adversely affect the sensory (organoleptic) properties of food and human health. Many plasticizers (phthalates) and additives are considered Endocrine Disruptors. They adversely affect the human reproductive system and are carcinogenic. Some of these chemicals are phthalate esters, alkylphenols (aps), 2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane and derivatives known as bisphenol A, and di (2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA). Continuous exposure to these components, even at very low concentrations, creates a serious toxic effect. Therefore, the foodstuffs used must be safe as well as the packaging materials to be used. The food packaging should protect and retain food and not release the unwanted non-food component in its structure. Food migratory substances adversely affect food quality as they give a bad odor to food and reduce consumer preference, and food safety because food migratory materials form residues in food.

New technologies (active / intelligent packaging, modified atmosphere or vacuum packaging, edible / edible packaging) are applied in the packaging of foods in order to protect the environment in a safer and longer-lasting manner, in the manner closest to the fresh state."

Soybean ( *Glycine max* , L.) has been part of Southeast Asia culture for almost 2 millennia. However, only in the second half of the 19th century has it started being used in the Western world coinciding with the Chinese migration to the USA. Today, USA, South America, especially Brazil, and Northwestern Europe, account for almost 90% of the world total soybean production. At first, the nutrition value of soybean was attributed to its high quality protein content thus attracting considerable interest for its use in human diet. Nowadays, it is known that soybeans are a rich source of phytochemicals, and many of those compounds have important beneficial effects on human and animal health.

Among the important phytochemicals in soybeans for human health, phytoestrogens, mainly, isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans, are the most widely studied. Nevertheless, saponins and phytosterols have also been the subject of research on soybeans. This chapter will discuss these phytochemicals compounds, their chemical structures, and their relationship with the major biological functions, scientifically proved, and their health benefits.

This research aimed at developing and analyzing the physicians chemical and sensory properties of cookies incorporated with black seed (Nigella sativa) oil. Black seed oil is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherol and bio active molecules.
The method involved a four formulation design that generate 5 ml, 10 ml, 15 ml, and 20 ml black seed oil with whey protein powder used for cookies along with whole wheat flour.
Sensory attributes and overall acceptability were measured separately using thirty in trained panelists with five point hedonic scale and selected the best formula with higher consumer acceptance. Quality attributes of selected sample was evaluated by conducting proximate analysis (Moisture %, crude fat %, crude protein %, Ash % and Sugar content)
and microbial analysis. cookie incorporated with black seed (Nigella sativa) oil ( T1-233) acquired the highest sensory acceptance.
Proximate analysis carried out according to the AOAC procedures revealed that the crude fat content 19.14 ± 0.04, crude protein content 8.75 ± 0.03, moisture content 3.19 ± 0.02, Ash content 1.91 ± 0.01, and sugar content 9.10 ± 0.01 were in the acceptable limits. The yeast & mold and TPC were no detected in T1-233 cookie sample. It can be concluded that, cookie incorporated with 5 ml black seed oil ( T1-233) were maintained best sensory attributes and proximate parameters in 3 weeks of storage life without adding any artificial preservatives."

2614,1,"Although it is known that most of the fatty acids found in nature are in cis form, trans fatty acids, which is a popular topic in nutritional physiology, are not naturally found in fats and they are mostly technological (partial hydrogenation, refining and partially frying). applications. With the development of capillary column gas chromatography method, trans isomers of fatty acids in various vegetable and animal oils have been easily identified. During the formation of milk in the rumen of cows, sheep, goats and other ruminants, Trans faty acid also occurs as a result of biological hydrogenation. Trans fatty acid is a form of geometric isomer seen in unsaturated fatty acids containing at least one double bond. Unsaturated fatty acids include two different isomeric structures, geometric and position isomers. This isomerism, depending on the configuration of the structure of hydrogen atoms in the form of cis and trans are available in two forms (Gunstone, 1986; Kayahan, 2002; Kiralan et al. 2006). Cis isomers are formed if the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the carbon chain and trans isomers are formed.


The double bond angle in the trans form is smaller than the cis form and the acyl chain is more linear. Because of this feature, the trans form, which has a more stable (higher melting point and thermo-dynamic stability) molecular structure than the cis form, melts at higher temperatures. For example, the cis form of oleic acid melts at 13.4 ºC and its trans form elaidic acid (C18: 1 t) melts at 43.5-45.5 ºC. This makes trans isomers attractive for the production of semi-solid oils and margarine / shortsening (Kayahan 2002; Kıralan 2006).

Nowadays, refined vegetable oils and pomace oil are used for adulteration in olive oil which is in the foreground as an important fat source of healthy nutrition. Various methods are used in the determination of these. Chromatographic methods are at the forefront of these methods. Analyzes are made on different criteria in determining the adulteration of different oils in olive oil. As a result, for the determination of adulteration in olive oil, adulteration control is performed by applying different criteria analyzes for refined vegetable oils and pomace oil.

The content of trans fatty acids of olive oil: Fatty acids normally in the form of -cis can be converted into raftrans form by refining process. If refined vegetable oil is added to olive oil which is not refined, the trans oil content and adulteration can be detected. Gas chromotography is used for the detection of trans fatty acids.

297,1,"#### Abstract

Certain natural dietary spices, in addition to their use in food flavoring and preservation, have the ability to detoxify or degrade a wide range of chemical carcinogens. In the present study, aqueous extracts of judiciously selected natural dietary spices were evaluated for their ability to degrade aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A total of 9 spices including garlic ( *Allium sativum* ), ginger ( *Zingiber officinale* ), black cumin ( *Nigella sativum* ), clove ( *Syzygium aromaticum* ), sacred basil ( *Ocimum basilicum* ), lemon grass ( *Cymbopogon citratus*  L. (DC)  *Stapf* )), thyme ( *Thymus schimperi* ), fenugreek ( *Trigonella foenum-graecum* ), and lemon traditionally used by the Ethiopian Community for food flavoring and preservation were considered. 

Aflatoxin degradation efficacy of the spice extracts was studied through determination of the toxin in extract-treated and nontreated samples using LC-MS/MS.


The degradation was characterized by electrochemical methods based on the characteristic oxidation peak of phenolic hydroxyl resulting from the degradation of the toxin after treatment with the extracts. Of the various spices, garlic showed the highest 35.8% (30 min) to 61.7% (1 hr) in spiked and 46.7% (30 min) to 68.3% (1 hr) and real-sample (contaminated maize) treatment reduction followed by lemon 34.2% (30 min) to 56.0% (1 hr) in spiked and 41.1% (30 min) to 60.6% (1 hr) in real-sample treatment at 25°C. The level of reduction was higher in real-sample treatment than that in spiked.



This suggests adsorptive contribution by the matrix in addition to the chemical degradation. The current findings revealed nonobvious benefits of the use of natural dietary spices as effective solution for AFB1 degradation and decontamination of food.

I would greatly appreciate your advice and help in improving my crispy snack production process and packaging. Here are some specific issues I’m facing:

1. Oiliness on the surface: After frying and baking, my snack tends to appear oily. Are there any methods or techniques to reduce this oily appearance?
2. Shelf life extension: My target shelf life is between 6-12 months. Are there specific food preservatives or natural additives you recommend that could help extend the shelf life while maintaining product quality?
3. Packaging concerns: I plan to use silica gel packets in my packaging to maintain crispness. However, I’m concerned that the silica gel packets may come into direct contact with the oily surface of my snack. Could this affect the product, and are there better alternatives for moisture control?"

It is common practice for many athletes and active adults to use protein supplements to enhance gains in lean muscle mass, and whey protein, in particular, is ideal due to its high levels of essential amino acids. Whey protein isolates, one of the most common forms of protein, are considered one of the best sources of protein available.

To date, no studies have examined the relative performance of whey protein that has undergone the patent-pending Ingredient Optimized process in order to enhance its effects on muscle protein synthesis and lean muscle anabolism. 

As such, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relative benefit of this ioProtein whey protein isolate, in combination with resistance exercise, on several measures of body composition among a sample of athletes in comparison with those associated with an untreated whey protein isolate.



 Twenty healthy male and female adults, between the ages of 18 and 37 years, were recruited. Results indicated that individuals who supplemented with the Ingredient Optimized whey protein saw a significant improvement in fat-free mass (p<0.5) compared to those taking non-optimized, non-treated whey protein. 

Moreover, individuals supplementing with Ingredient Optimized whey protein also experienced significantly enhanced performance on bench press (p<0.5), squat (p<0.5), recovery time (p<0.5), and stomach discomfort (p<0.5), which was not reported from individuals taking the non-optimized control whey protein.

This guidance document is intended to help food operators who process, prepare and handle food to
determine the shelf life of their food products and to apply appropriate date marking. It describes:
* how shelf life is defined;
* the causes of food deterioration and spoilage;
* why food may become unsafe during storage;
* how to decide whether a ‘best-before’ or ‘use-by’ date mark is required;
* the information needed to work out what the shelf life is; and
* how to ensure the safety of chilled foods.
* 
The shelf life of many foods can be extended through various means including chilled storage. 

Low temperatures slow down chemical changes and growth of many spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and moulds) and any toxin formation. However some pathogenic bacteria are able to grow at the low temperatures used for refrigeration and chilled storage. These are referred to as cold-tolerant bacteria.

The type and length of storage may provide the suitable conditions and time for the cold-tolerant bacteria to grow in number so that the food becomes unsafe after a period of time, even if low numbers are present after manufacture. 

This will impact on the shelf life and safety of the food especially where the food is considered to be ready-to-eat. Ready-to-eat foods are those foods where there is no further processing that will reduce or eliminate harmful microorganisms before consumption.

The focus of this guidance document is therefore on determining the shelf life of chilled ready-to-eat foods.

This guidance document may provide some useful information for manufacturers and processors of other foods.

In this guidance document for any references to sections included refer to sections in this guidance document unless it is otherwise stated.

The study was carried out to demonstrate the effect of walnut flour enhancement on the physical, nutritional, and sensory quality of bread. Walnut flour was prepared by soaking, deshelling, oven drying, and sieving whole walnuts. 

The wheat flour was supplemented with walnut flour by 0, 20, 30, 40, and 50% of the total amount. Standard procedures were taken to estimate the proximate composition of wheat and walnut flour and bread samples. A comparison between the control and supplemented bread was made, where the physical characteristics (weight, volume, and specific volume) and sensory quality were checked.

The enhanced bread, where the percentage was between 20 and 50%, appeared to have a significant increase in protein, fat, linoleic acid, and  *α* -linolenic acid and a decrease in carbohydrate and fibre values. Increased walnut flour replacement showed that physical properties, loaf volume and specific loaf volume, have declined. The sensory attributes between the unsupplemented and supplemented bread showed major differences. As an outcome, substituting 30% walnut flour gave the best overall quality of bread acceptability.

*Candida rugosa*  lipase is a food-grade enzyme that is extensively utilized in the dairy processing industry for milk fat hydrolysis. The enzyme is mainly employed to modify the fatty acid chain length that results in the enhancement of flavors. 


The hydrolytic activities of  *C. rugosa*  lipase (fungal source) in its free and immobilized forms were investigated at different pH and temperature settings. The main objective of this study was to understand how different support materials (Celite-545, Sephadex G-25, and chitosan) and immobilization techniques alter lipase activity and stability. Our results indicated that hydrolytic activity increased significantly with immobilization on Celite-545. In general, immobilization resulted in considerable improvements in the stability of the enzyme with variations in pH and temperature. Immobilization on Celite-545 led to the highest catalytic efficiency. 


Remarkable improvements in the recovery and reusability of the immobilized lipases were noted. Comparatively, the acetone immobilization procedure resulted in higher activities than alcohol immobilization. In conclusion, the activity of  *C. rugosa*  lipase was enhanced most significantly when immobilized on Celite-545 using acetone as an adsorption solvent.

Meat is a good source of many nutrients and protein in the human diet. In this study, strips of marinated beef were deep fried in oil, packaged and stored under three storage conditions.

The study was carried out to determine the proximate composition, oxidative and microbial stability of meat sample marinated with spices of different particle sizes (250, 300 and 500 μm).


The untreated sample was compared with marinated samples and stored under ambient, refrigeration and freezing temperatures. The results showed that spice particle size affected protein, fat and ash content of the meat during storage at p&lt;0.01 while the effect on moisture content and carbohydrate was at p&lt;0.001. Samples marinated with 250 μm had the lowest microbial growth (6.0 × 104) and lowest oxidative rancidity value (0.40).

Combined spices give a synergistic effect which is more potent in the inhibition of microbial growth and oxidative rancidity.

To determine the hygiene and processing aspects and the microbiological quality of soft white cheese produced traditionally in Jordan, 30 samples were collected from dairy workshops and plants in major Governorates of Jordan. 

A questionnaire was filled by interviewing each producer about the quality, Food hygiene and safety aspects of production prevailing during processing were also investigated.

The averages of log10 of the standard plate count (SPC), and the counts of lactic acid bacteria count (LABC), Enterobacteriaceae (EntC) and yeast and mold (Y&amp;MC) were 8.3, 7.9, 5.4 and 3.0, respectively. A significant positive correlation (0.90) was noticed between SPC and LABC, indicating that most of SPC were LABC. 

Staphylococcus aureus count ranged between 5-8 log10 CFU/g whereas Salmonella was positive in 25 g in three cheeses samples of Madaba and Amman governorates which certainly pose health hazard. The averages of pH, acidity (% lactic acid), moisture and salt (NaCl%) in brine and in cheese and ash were 6.0, 0.53%, 56.5%, 12.6%, 9.4%, and 9.5, respectively.

Fourteen of the samples gave positive results to the alkaline phosphatase test, denoting the probability of using unpasteurized milk in the production.

The high microbial content of the cheese samples especially S. aureus and presence of Salmonella in few samples reflects generally the poor hygienic conditions during production and storage, lack of refrigeration and absence of heat treatment to eliminate microorganisms. It could be concluded also from the results of the questionnaires that there is a lack of standardized method for production and keeping of soft white cheese in Jordan.

**Abstract**

Olive oil, and especially virgin olive oil (VOO) and extra VOO, has great interest worldwide because of its unique fatty acid profile, phenolic compounds with positive health properties for the human health and appreciated aroma profile.

However, the composition of VOO can change dramatically depending on the olive variety, field management, olive fruit maturity degree, harvesting and processing, which can affect its final characteristic flavour. At industrial level, the extraction conditions applied can affect the concentration and composition of phenolic and volatile compounds, with possible negative consequence and the formation of off-flavours. Olive crushing, malaxation, centrifugation, filtration and storage were reported to be all possible factors affecting VOO flavour.

The present review paper describes the factors affecting the virgin olive oils composition, with a focus on the aroma compounds, biophenols and the resulting sensory profile. A particular focus was put on the volatile and phenolic compounds and their relation with the sensory description and impact of the final flavour. In conclusion, many factors still need to be studied to fully understand the complex composition and interactions of this appreciated product. This information is also relevant and useful both for scientific knowledge and for its industrial application, as producers can modulate the final characteristics of the VOO.

The hypothesis was that endogenous lipids from cocoa were responsible for driving the formation of stable oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions. The data presented includes relative quantification of phospholipids from different commercially available cocoa material using 31P NMR spectroscopy and analyses of the emulsifying power of delipidified cocoa material. The commercially available cocoa material comprised several phospholipids, with phosphatidylcholine being the most abundant in all samples. Dispersions of delipidified cocoa material were found to drive the formation of o/w emulsions despite the absence of lipids. We therefore concluded that the emulsifying behavior of cocoa material is not entirely reliant upon the endogenous lipids. This suggests that cocoa material may have a new and potentially widespread use in industrial food preparation and may inform manufacturing strategies for novel food grade emulsifiers.

Its consumption has positive effect on energy expenditure, power of muscle, while over consumption has negative effects widely debated. Across geographical areas, coffee brews may notably change when preparing Espresso, American, French, Turkish, etc. 

This chapter reviewed the phases able to affect the amount of caffeine in cup. Three most important areas will be addressed: (1) coffee varieties and environment; (2) coffee processing operations; (3) brewing methods extraction variables. 

What arises from the state of art is that, although there is a significant agreement on the effect of each critical variable on caffeine extraction, there is also a great difficulty to precisely know how much caffeine is in a coffee cup, although this is the most important information for the consumers. 

The number of affecting variables is very high, and some of them are inversely related with caffeine content (brewing time and brew volume), while others exhibit a direct relationship (grinding level, dose, and tamping). Finally, some variables under the control of barista rarely are accurately reproduced during brewing. 

For instance, it was found that the caffeine content in a Starbuck’s coffee cup during different days varied significantly.

10479,1,"Hi everyone!

I am trying to make a vegan butter with coconut oil as the base, and I found that as the butter emulsion crystalizes and stays in the cold temperature, it will turn rock solid instead of soft and spreadable (like margarine plasticity texture). 

I have a stable emulsion in my system, so I am guessing that it has to do with the crystallization process of the fat. Does anyone know how the margarine crystallizer works to make that plastic texture? can I apply the same process to my vegan butter? or is there any suggestion for a better way to crystalize my vegan butteremulsion better?"

The addition of dietary fibers to foods confers three different types of benefits. Their
nutritional value motivates consumers to eat increased quantities of dietary fibers, which is
advised by nutritionists. Their technological properties are of great interest to food
manufacturers. 

Finally, dietary fibers may also be used to upgrade agricultural products
and by-products for use as food ingredients. Consequently, both the nutritional value and
technological properties of dietary fibers are important in the potential development of a
wide range of fiber-enriched foods for example: bakery products, snacks, sauces, drinks,
cereals, cookies, dairy products, meat products.

12560,1,"The European Food Safety Authority is re-evaluating styrene for assessing the safety of
food contact materials (FCM) such as polystyrene (PS) and started a systematic review of the data
on migration levels in food. A restriction for styrene is expected in the near future. The main food
contact application of PS is dairy packaging, mainly at refrigerated storage. In this study, seventeen dairy products packed in PS taken from the Italian and German markets were investigated. 

Styrene concentrations in the refrigerated dairy products (yogurt, cream) ranged from 5 to 30 µg/kg at the best before date, while in single serving portions of coffee creamer, which were stored at room temperature until the best before date of approx. 190 days, 401 µg/kg were measured. Among several parameters, the ratio between the surface contact area of the package and the quantity of the food packed, the time/temperature conditions of production/filling and storage of the products were identified as the main factors influencing styrene migration into food under realistic conditions.

Yogurts fermented in the pots for approximately 8 h at 40–50 ◦C showed higher styrene levels than those fermented in an incubator and filled at 20 ◦C. The fat content might influence the styrene level but the effect, if any, was too small in relation to the variability of other parameters. Levels of styrene migrating into 50% ethanol food simulant under standardized condition (10 days/40 ◦C) were found to be much higher than levels in refrigerated foods. This raises the question as to whether compliance testing for PS plastics should be adapted taking into consideration the correlation between migration testing by laboratory simulations and migration into real food.

High-intensity ultrasound offers an alternative to traditional methods of food preservation and is regarded as a green, versatile, popular, and promising emerging technology. Ultrasound generates acoustic cavitation in a liquid medium, developing physical forces that are considered the main mechanism responsible for the observed changes in exposed materials. In meat, ultrasound has been successfully used to improve processes such as mass transfer and marination, tenderization of meat ,and inactivation of microorganisms. It is also an alternative to traditional meat aging methods for improving the quality properties of meat. 

Moreover, the combination of ultrasonic energy with a sanitizing agent can improve the effect of microbial reduction in foods. This review describes recent potential applications of ultrasound in meat systems, as well as physical and chemical effects of ultrasound treatments on the conservation and modification of processed meat foods.

Evolution of food processes is driven by changes in consumer preferences and the need to produce safe and high-quality foods. Nonthermal or intermediate technologies have great potential to achieve the characteristics desired by both the industry and consumers, especially regarding the desire to avoid altering the flavor or nutritional content during production. These technologies, which include the use of high pressure, electrical pulses, microfiltration, and ultrasonication, are especially designed for economy, simplicity, and energy efficiency. Ultrasound is an acoustic energy , and therefore, it is a nonionizing, noninvasive, and nonpolluting form of mechanical energy. These properties lead to a wide range of applications in the food industry. It is considered an emerging method with a great potential to control, improve, and accelerate processes without damaging the quality of food and other products . 

A low-power and high-frequency method is used to monitor the composition and physicochemical properties of food components and products during processing. Therefore, it contributes to control the properties that improve food quality. In recent years, research studies have been focused on assessing the effects of ultrasound on processes including mass transfer or marinating, meat tenderizing, crystallization, freezing, drying, degassing, filtration, foam production and reduction, emulsification, homogenization, and inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes . Ultrasound has also been employed to optimize physicochemical characteristics, preparation processes for meat products, microbiological content, and sensory characteristics in fresh and processed meat . Although ultrasound waves have been used to improve a wide variety of characteristics for a variety of matrices and processes, the appropriate conditions for scaling ultrasonic methods up to industrial levels have been established for a relatively small number of processes .

As emphasized by Chemat et al. a key goal of ultrasound research is to study and analyze both desirable and undesirable degradation phenomena in foods resulting from ultrasonic treatment (e.g., ultrasonic processing may affect the texture and chemical composition of foods). For this reason, many research questions in the meat sector are yet to be elucidated. Although multiple reports have been published, still inconsistent results have been reported, maybe because of the specific nature of meat tissues and various factors of ultrasound application possibly involved in, affecting food properties. This review aims to identify the effect of ultrasound on the major quality characteristics of fresh meat. We believe the results will help establish a methodology to enable the scaling-up of ultrasonic technology to the industrial level.

6576,1,"Mycotoxins are toxic low molecular compounds produced by the secondary metabolism of certain fungal species and are known to impose severe health effects on both humans and animals. In most cases they occur in tropical and temperate regions and are known to affect major agricultural commodities such as nuts, cereals spices, seeds, coffee and fruits (Rodrigues et al., 2012). Mycotoxins are mostly produced during storage of agricultural commodities but their formation can take place even during processing (Buszewska-Forajta, 2020). The most toxic category of mycotoxins is aflatoxins which are known for their carcinogenic potential as well as for the damage they can cause to liver (Buszewska-Forajta, 2020).

According to Codex, mycotoxins levels in foods must be very low because of their high toxicity.  For instance, Codex has set the maximum levels for aflatoxins for a variety of nuts, grains, dried figs and milk which are fall in the range of 0.5 to 15 µg/kg (WHO, 2018). Intense efforts have been made globally in order to efficiently manage mycotoxins, though an early detection and identification is crucial. Certain biosensors may provide with accurate and rapid results like in the case of a colorimetric sensor with zinc oxide nanoparticles which has been recently developed and proved very efficient in detecting aflatoxin B1 in rice (Khansili et al. 2020). Therefore, do you believe that biosensors can become high potential tool for the detections of mycotoxins from agricultural commodities?

The draft regulations for the same are in the process of being notified and the process of draft notification, consideration of comments, if any that may be received, and the finalisation of the above -mentioned regulations are likely to take some time. However, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has permitted the use of food grade packaging materials for packaged water other than those mentioned in the regulations. NGT has permitted this in order to reduce and manage plastic waste. Since other food grade packaging material is being permitted for packaging water, therefore the FSSAI has decided to operationalise the regulations regarding the specific migration limits of Antinomy and Phthalic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester (DEHP) for plastic material intended to be in contact with articles of food.

Henceforth all Food Business Operators must follow the revised regulations but the enforcement of these regulations shall commence after 6 months from the date of issue of these directions or after the final notification in the Gazette of India, whichever is later.

In the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Amendment Regulations 2018 under regulation regarding Specific Requirements for Primary Food Packaging, in the sub-regulation category (4) regarding Plastic Materials intended to come in contact with food products, the FSSAI had proposed adding the following provision for packaging of drinking water

“other food grade packaging materials compatible with the water to be packaged may also be used. In such cases requirement of transparent bottle would not apply.”

The amendment regarding the specific migration limits of substances from plastic materials intended to be in contact with articles of food, the following specifications have been added to the existing ones.

1011,1,"In many countries where milk production is high, a significant amount of milk is used for cheese production. The most important factor determining the yield and quality of cheese in cheese making is the coagulation property of milk. For this reason, coagulation of milk with rennet, which is the basis of cheese production for the dairy industry, is of great importance. The coagulation of casein micelles forms the basis of cheese making. Coagulation occurs in two different ways, usually with acid and enzyme. In both methods, casein changes to insoluble form and forms a non-degradable network structure. In acid coagulation, the protein network is loose, whereas in enzyme coagulation, the protein network is tight and elastic.

a) Coagulation of Casein by Acid Effect

During acidification, different biochemical changes are observed in casein micelles. These changes are demineralization of casein micelles, protonation of acid groups, decrease in solubility, hydration of caseins and zeta potential. These successive events cause precipitation of caseins if acidification is rapid and gelation if acidification is slow.

Casein micelles are very sensitive to pH changes. As an increase in the amount of lactic acid in milk, Colloidal Calcium Phosphate, an important building block of casein complex, dissolves away from the structure. Degradation of casein micelles is considered to be caused by differentiation of the surface of micelles. Increased acidity causes the coagulation by neutralizing the negative charge on the micelle surface.

The easiest clotting of casein occurs at pH 4.6. This pH is the isoelectric point of casein. At this point, the positive and negative electrical charges of the caseins are equal.

Heat treatment also has an effect on the coagulation of casein with acid effect. Denaturing serum proteins by heat treatment create--casein and S-S bridges, reducing electrostatic and steric repulsion, resulting in higher pH coagulation of caseins.

b) Coagulation of Casein by Enzymatic Effect

Proteolytic enzymes from some plant, animal and microbial sources coagulate casein. All of these enzymes belong to the group of acid proteases. In particular, one of the animal proteases rennet (chymosin) enzyme is used in cheese technology.

Coagulation of casein micelles by the effect of chymosin enzyme; (a) enzymatic proteolysis, (b) aggregation (agglomeration), and (c ) gelling."

14042,1,"Hello everyone,

I would like to ask a few question.

At first, I work in a factory that produces Turkish delight with lemon flavour (natural). Shelf life of Turkish Delight is nearly 6 month and we add %0.06 flavour Although, we use a very small amount of flavour, the product is obtained hard and dry. How can we prevent this situation?

Does the acidity of lemon flavour affect the texture of the Turkish Delight? 

Second one, what does the meaning of FSC Board? Is it a certification documents or a material matter?

Thank you"

Example, Echinacea is very popular - I haven't seen an NDI for it.  It is not GRAS per 21cfr (at I least I don't think so).  So where are these people getting marketing information that dates back to 1994?

FDA clearly states sources like Herbs of Commerce or the unofficial ""Grandfathered"" list from CRN are not sources for proof.

Since it's such a common ingredient, I agree with my superiors it is ""low risk"" but am not comfortable without anything backing up that our ingredient is ODI..."

This paper contains a comprehensive review of different types of foreign matter reported in Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) during the period 2016 – 2018. 

It provides information on incidents of foreign matter contamination discussed and mined in terms of types of foreign bodies, food products involved and geographic distribution within indicated European regions. 

By analysing the presence of foreign bodies in different European regions (Eastern, Northern, Southern, Western Europe), we found, by means of statistical evaluation, that there were differences in some of the data obtained with respect to the country reporting a foreign body. We found that plastic, glass and metal were the most commonly reported in Western Europe, pests and rubber in Northern Europe. 

As far as food commodities are concerned, bakery and confectionery products, fruit and vegetables and convenience foods were most frequently reported and the notifications came most often from Western Europe. Notifications from this part of Europe were made with regard to other monitored commodities as well. Regarding the notification type, the most frequent one was an alert and, in the case of a risk decision, serious risk constituted the largest part.

Ionization radiations are used to ensure food safety and quality. This irradiation process uses ions of beta or gamma rays to inactivate or destroy the food spoilage pests, microorganisms and their toxins without significantly increasing the temperature of the treated product.

Meanwhile, various intrinsic and extrinsic factors are involved in determining the efficacy of ionization irradiation against these organisms. Therefore, the dose of radiations is recommended according to the type of irradiation, substrate and microorganisms. However, controversies are surrounding the use of irradiations in the food industry due to a negative perception of irradiations. This manuscript described the use of ionization radiations to control the foodborne biological hazards and increase shelf life.


Firstly, the characteristics and mode of action of irradiations were discussed. Secondly, the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing the radioresistance of biological hazards were elaborated. This literature review also detailed the differential effects of irradiations on different microorganisms and pests having a role in food safety and deterioration. Finally, the regulatory status and the consumer values along with the controversies surrounding the use of ionization irradiations in the food sector were explained.

Demand of nutrition based functional food biscuit increasing rapidly due to the increasing awareness about the health, avoiding unhealthy backing foods and sufficient amount of nutraceuticals activities . The consumer trend has widened, many have begun to look at food not only for its basic nutrition but also for the allied health. Benefits.black seed termed as herbal .They have most health benefits and nutrition.Fixed oil and essential oil are obtain from black seed. That fixed oil is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and to some extent thymoquinone, whilst essential oil is abundant in bioactive molecules like thymoquinone, p-cymene, carvacrol, α-thujene and thymol. It has many biological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and wound healing activities.

Biscuits ,being higher in fat contents, would be a better carrier for provision of desirable quantities of antioxidants and tocopherols to the vulnerable segments by adding black cumin fixed and essential oil in various proportions. flour, water, fats (black seed Fixed oil and essential oil), sugars (sucrose, invert) and chemical leaveners (ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and sodium acid pyrophosphate).

Keeping in view the above, the present research proposal was designed to Development black seed oil (fixed & essential ) functional food biscuit and it will be a best value added product in food in market.

The purpose of the research is we can develop adding up of black cumin fixed and essential oils in Cereal-based food products like biscuits and we can eat this daily an alternative for high calories biscuits. Because of these, we can cure our health issues and nutritional problems as soon as possible."

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open
waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less
attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity
studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be
known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and
beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples
of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of
commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic
particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1±5 mm in
length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic
debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99%
were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average
number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/
L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with
a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the
average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources
annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).

15392,1,"Inhibition of Clostridium perfringens in High-Moisture, Uncured Turkey Products by Vinegar-Based Clean-Label Ingredients During Extended Cooling





The United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) Appendix B guidelines identify cooling options to prevent growth of *Clostridium perfringens* in uncured meat and poultry products where Phase 1 cooling (between 49 and 27°C) is limited to 1 h and continued chilling to 4°C. 

This study screened several commercially available vinegar-based clean-label ingredients to inhibit *C. perfringens* in a model poultry product during extension of Phase 1 cooling. 

Eight uncured turkey products (75% moisture, 1.5% salt, pH 6.6 and 6.2) were formulated with no antimicrobial (control) or 1% dry vinegar (DV), dry vinegar-cultured sugar (DV-CS), or dry vinegar-fruit-spice-extract (DV-FSE). 

The batter was inoculated with 2.5-log CFU/g *C. perfringens* spores (3-strain mixture), vacuum- packaged (25 g/pouch), cooked to 70°C, and cooled according to the following schedule: Phase 1 (48.9 – 26.7°C) in 2, 3, 4, or 5 h; Phase 2 (26.7 – 12.8°C) in 5 h; and Phase 3 (12.8 – 4.4°C) in 5 h (total cooling 12, 13, 14, or 15 h). Triplicate samples were enumerated after cooking and at the end of each phase; each experiment was replicated twice. 

As expected, *C. perfringens* grew rapidly in control samples (> 1.5-log and > 6-log for the 2- and 5-h extended Phase 1 cooling, respectively). In contrast, treatments containing 1% DV or DV-FSE inhibited 1-log growth at pH 6.6 and 6.2 when Phase 1 cooling was extended to 2 and 3 h, respectively. 

Turkey containing 1% DV-CS at pH 6.6 and 6.2 inhibited *C. perfringens* to ≤ 1-log when Phase 1 was extended 4 and 5 h, respectively. 

This study confirms that DV-based clean-label antimicrobials can be used by manufacturers to extend Phase 1 cooling of uncured meat and poultry products beyond the recommendations in the 2021 USDA-FSIS Appendix B Option 2 Stabilization Guidelines. Further research is needed to compare the efficacy of similar ingredients among various suppliers.

The modified atmosphere packaging method is one of the most common methods used in food preservation. MAP is one of the most important food preservation techniques that preserves natural quality and extends the shelf life of fresh or minimally processed foods. MAP, which is one of the physical protection methods, is based on the principle of significantly extending the shelf life by creating a suitable atmosphere environment to prevent or restrict microbial growth of foods.It is the creation of suitable atmospheric conditions to prolong the shelf life of the product by removing air from the package or by adding different gases. In other words, it is a modification of the air composition surrounding the product.

**What** **are** **the** **aims** **of** **Modified** **Atmosphere** **Packaging** **?**

-Reduce total oxygen

-Reduce enzymatic and oxidative degradation reactions

-Providing product safety and quality by delaying microbiological deterioration

-Extend shelf life

**What** **are** **the** **Modified** **Atmosphere** **Packaging** **Foods** **?**

-Fruits and vegetables

-Meat and meat products

-Milk and milk products

-Bakery products

-Seafood

-Ready Products

**What** **are** **the** **Modified** **Atmosphere** **Packaging** **Types** **?**

-Passive Modification; fruits are applied to vegetables.

- Active Modification; It is applied to all kinds of food.

**What** **is** **Passive** **Modification** **?**

-The product is coated with suitable plastic film considering the respiration rates.

- Ambient atmosphere occurs spontaneously by respiration.

- The packaging material should allow more carbon dioxide output than oxygen input.

- It is not desirable to increase the carbon dioxide level above 20%.

- It is not desirable for the oxygen level to fall below 2%.

**What** **is** **Active** **Modification** **?**

-Getting the desired composition gas into the packaging.

-Not made for fruits and vegetables. Because oxygen is needed for maturation.

-A modifier kit or absorbant is placed in the packaging.

-Vacuum packaging.

**What** **are** **the** **Advantages** **of** **Modified** **Atmosphere** **Packaging** **?**

-Increases potential shelf life by 50% - 400%.

-Reduces economic losses.

At the same time, consumers have become more demanding with respect to the quality of meat and meat products. Producing high quality meat consistently is a big challenge for meat producers, processors, and retailers due to the intrinsic variability of the raw material, but it also generates the necessity to develop, improve, and upgrade the current quality analyses by faster and more reliable ones. Precisely, as results of the recent technological and biotechnological advances, a plethora of new possibilities have been opened for the meat production and processing sectors, and a vast improvement of the quality assessment and assurance throughout the whole processing could now be a reality. This special issue aims to cover the recent advances on quality assurance and assessment of fresh meat and meat products.

Eight different articles were finally accepted for publishing, after the editorial and peer-reviewing process. The average number of authors for each paper is 5.6, and the authors’ affiliated institutes are from a wide variety of countries, such as New Zealand, Germany, Vietnam, China, Poland, Spain, and Ireland. This special issue covers a variety of topics that can be associated in different groups: consumer acceptance studies, emerging analytical methods, or effect of processing conditions.

With regard to the animal production line, A. Albrecht et al. studied the influence of an alternative production system based on a slow-growing, corn-fed, and antibiotics-free chicken line compared with conventional poultry production, on the quality and shelf life of poultry meat. This paper clearly represents an opportunity towards a more sustainable poultry production due to an extensive husbandry system without antibiotics, a slower growth, and enhanced animal welfare advance in line with latest consumer demands.

Insights on the manufacturing and processing procedures to improve meat quality and safety have been given by other authors. Freezing is one of the most commonly used methods for preservation in the meat industry, and thus its effect on the quality of the final product is paramount. D. Li et al. investigated the effect of freezing conditions on mutton meat quality and structure. The importance of this study lies not only on the effect of freezing on meat microstructure but also on their innovative approach and the techniques used in the study. The paper by R. Zhang et al. aimed also to investigate the effect of freezing, but in this case on dry-aged beef meat. The use of freezing on this type of meat is not common, but it proved to be an interesting approach to extend the shelf life of the final products; however, the effect of freezing on quality parameters should be carefully assessed in this high-value product. A. Augustyńska-Prejsnar et al. completed this area with the study of the effect of different marinades on meat quality and microbiological safety of pheasant, relatively under the studied type of meat. In general, these studies highly contributed to ideas for innovation on the meat industry especially for that based on gourmet products such as pheasant or dry aged-beef.

M. M. Farouk et al. delved into the consumer preference field. They designed an acceptability survey of one of the most consumed meat products for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people: hot pot beef with several fat percentages. The study purposed by M. M. Farouk et al. goes beyond meat quality itself and brings knowledge of the effect of different productive, processing, and cooking methodologies on beef meat digestibility. These studies are not very common, and the information they provide is key from a nutritional and consumer marketing point of view.

The present special issue is finally completed with the in-depth review paper from this editorial group (C. Álvarez et al.), and the one presented by M. A. Cook and P. Duc Phuc. The former focuses on the measurements that are used or can be used during the rigor period in order to predict eating quality early. This comprehensive review is particularly interesting in the field since it deepens in the high number of unstudied measurements that can be easily applied during this stage and the lack of relationship of many of the used methods with final meat quality, highlighting the need of further studies. Finally, M. A. Cook and P. Duc Phuc reviewed the major pathogens and hazards identified in Southeast Asia related to the consumption of pork. This study focuses on food-borne disease impact and incidence due to pork consumption. The paper is especially interesting due to the necessity to address the high impact of food-borne disease on low- and middle-income countries.

In summary, we are pleased to introduce this special issue covering meat quality aspects from the animal production line to the consumer preference and the effect of the manufacturing processes. We sincerely hope that the readers will find this special issue interesting and informative.

I have just been A new member of the forum. Actually, i am currently getting a problem with my dairy product. I really appreciate if receive all of your advice.

My product contains cheese powder, vegetable fat powder, emulsifier (E471) and malic acid. I use malic acid for coagulation of the mixture. The problem is that when i put tap water into the mixture (containing malic acid powder before), then stir, there is something causing sandiness after the protein is coagulated. But when putting water first, stir the mixture and then add malic acid, the product is created with smooth mouthfeel and no sandiness. And my desired product must contain malic acid in the powdered mixture, not adding after putting water into and sandiness of final product (after adding water and stirring) is not unacceptable.

So, could you please tell me how to overcome this problem. Thank you very much"

Since the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century, the world has discovered new sources of pollution nearly every day. So, air and water can potentially become polluted everywhere. Little is known about changes in pollution rates. The increase in water-related diseases provides a real assessment of the degree of pollution in the environment. This chapter summarizes water quality parameters from an ecological perspective not only for humans but also for other living things. According to its quality, water can be classified into four types. Those four water quality types are discussed through an extensive review of their important common attributes including physical, chemical, and biological parameters. These water quality parameters are reviewed in terms of definition, sources, impacts, effects, and measuring methods.

2440,1,"We present a proof of concept for quick screening and alerting of coliform/E. coli contamination in water samples using a device attached to a smartphone. Current methods of coliform detection rely upon relatively expensive laboratory-based time consuming techniques which require trained manpower and take at least 24-48 hours. This waiting time prevents quick action and the consequences can be severe since the contaminated water may already have been consumed by then. Instead an unattended smartphone can continuously monitor the sample and send an alert as soon as contamination is detected. Smartphones, especially older or unused ones, fitted with a customized compact incubator and a sample holder, can be set to take photos of the sample (mixed with a selective growth medium) at regular intervals. An image analysis algorithm would analyze the photos and predict contamination as soon as it notices any increase in turbidity and/or change in color of the sample under observation due to bacterial growth. 



On detection of contamination, alerts can be immediately sent out to the concerned parties and intervention can be made without any potentially harmful delay. To test this concept we built a prototype for the detection of coliform/E. coli contamination in water samples. With the initial bacterial counts varying from 1-10 to >108 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml of water samples, all the results were produced within a turnaround time of 4 to 12 hours and found to be comparable with conventional microbiological methods which require 24-48 hours of incubation.

Hello All,
I want to produce snack bars with honey.
Can I say ""no added sugar"" on my labels? 

Legislation says that;
### WITH NO ADDED SUGARS

**A claim stating that sugars have not been added to a food, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product does not contain any added mono- or disaccharides or any other food used for its sweetening properties. If sugars are naturally present in the food, the following indication should also appear on the label: 'CONTAINS NATURALLY OCCURRING SUGARS**'.

( source: EFSA )

Is HONEY considered as ""food used for its sweetening properties"" ? 
If yes , why DATES are  NOT considered as ""food used for its sweetening properties"" ? 

I assume, writing NO ADDED SUGAR with the snack bars with honey is acceptable. What do you think? Please give me your comments

2753,1,"Hi,

I'm a professor in a program that offers a BS and MS in ""Nutrition and Food Science"". To date, although the degree is quite diluted with classes outside the scope of traditional food science, it seems we've had very good success with employers taking our graduates seriously in applications for food science positions.

As a recent movement to better incorporate faculty expertise, and make something ""visionary"", and ""forward thinking"", etc., the department is considering shifting our program title to something more unique and comprehensive. Among the rough initial ideas considered:

- Sustainable Food Production
- Sustainability in Food and Wellness
- Food Sustainability
- Future of Food and Wellness
- Etc..?

My concern has been that potential employers in the food industry will look at these on applicant's resumes and say ""that's not food science... next applicant!"". But, to be honest, I really don't know. Perhaps employers could find some of these appealing, forward-thinking and employable? I think perhaps the first one has the best shot at that.

I would really like for our department to be inclusive of all its faculty and create a good-spirited program, but I'm quite concerned we'd be negating our students' ability to be qualified for jobs. I would very much appreciate other people's thoughts and insights on this matter. Or if anyone has suggestions of what they've seen work, that would be great as well! Thanks so much!"

999,1,"The Maillard reaction is not a single reaction, it is a complex series of reactions between amino acids and reducing sugars, usually at elevated temperatures. It is a kind of non-enzymatic browning, such as caramelization. The commercial success of food products exposed to microwave technology plays a major role in the color and aroma of the product. It is especially important to achieve the color and aroma that is generated by the Maillard reaction.

In this process, hundreds of different flavor compounds are produced. These compounds break down into new flavor compounds. During the Maillard reaction, very specific flavor compounds are formed in each type of food.

Maillard reactions are important in all oven-baked, fried or other heat-treated foods. Maillard reactions are responsible for the flavor of bread, cookies, cakes, meat, beer, chocolate, popcorn, rice. In many cases, like coffee, flavor is a combination of Maillard reactions and caramelization. However, while caramelization occurs only above 120-150 ° C, Maillard reactions occur at room temperature.

On the other hand, in foods exposed to microwave heating / cooking, color and aroma changes due to Maillard reactions cannot be seen in foods cooked by conventional methods.

In addition, the loss of aromas generated in the process or added later during microwave cooking is much greater than in conventional methods.

Factors such as the difference between microwave and conventional cooking mechanisms, the composition of the food, and the design of the microwave oven cause the desired color and aroma not to be achieved.

Microwave heating affects the formation of Maillard reaction in food in two ways;

 -relationship between microwaves and food

 -effect of microwave heating on chemical reaction

Color, volatile aroma compounds, final amounts of products resulting from Maillard reaction of non-volatile compounds; temperature, humidity, pH and heating time.

The addition of different salts such as NaCl, CaCl2 and Na2SO4 increases both browning intensity and formation of aroma compounds. Increasing the electrolytes and pH increases the speed of Maillard reactions in microwave model systems. Although it is related to the ionic conduction mechanism in microwave application, it is also related to the change of water activity by adding salt to the medium."

12285,1,"food preservation and processing

Food preservation is a key part of food processing. Preserving food is a form of processing it, and many other forms of food processing require the food to be preserved first. There are many different food preservation methods in use, some of which can be done at home and others that require the use of commercial food manufacturing equipment.

Methods of food preservation that anybody can do at home include:

* Baking food in an oven to dry it out
* Air-drying food
* Potting
* Blanching
* Jellying
* Freezing
* Fermentation
* Preserving in salt or sugar
* Pickling
* Preserving food in alcohol
* Preserving food in olive oil
* Canning

The goal of many of these food preservation methods is to completely block air from reaching the food and causing a chemical reaction that results in spoilage. This includes the moisture within the food evaporating and contact between food tissues and oxygen causing oxidation."

Hi all,

I am not sure which is true because i did not find an exact info on regulations about this for Europe.

**Yes for USA it is clear fiber is counted as Carbohyrate on labels**

Question is for UE.

*Should we include fibre in carbohydrate count on food label in Europe*

Example:

If a food contains 10 g sucrose and 5 g inulin.

Which one is true ? 1 or 2?

**Dietary fibre is not accounted for within total carbohydrate on labelling.**

But there is no similar sentence in regulation documents.

Yes, there are some definitions as below ( REGULATION (EU) No 1169/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL );

but fibre can be absorbed after fermented by microorganisms in human colon so can we call them as carbohyrates?

Abstract

Camel is considered as one of the most important and ecologically harmless domesticated animals in the dry region of Asia and Africa. Camels have considerable economic importance not only as a draught animal, but also for their milk and its by-products. 

They can produce a significant amount of milk from poor feed as compared to any other dairy species. This characteristic, in addition to the growing recognition of the economic value, and health benefits of camel milk make it a center of attention for people, particularly in arid- and semi-arid areas.





Moreover, camel milk is a highly nutritious medium permissive for the growth of many diverse bacterial species. These bacterial populations are mainly grouped into pathogenic, spoilage, and technologically relevant bacteria. 


This chapter reviews the existing knowledge on the composition, nutritional value, health-promoting properties, and economic value of camel milk and its by-products. Furthermore, the relevant studies describing the microbiota of camel milk are included.

Molasses communiqué:
In the Turkish food codex, there are two parameters leading to the molasses related to molasses. 1.Parameter pH
The second parameter is Hydroxy Methyl Furfural.The pH of the concentrated grape produced in Turkey and other neighboring countries, from 4 to 4.8, the pH value in spite of this notification should be minimum 5.2 d. sodium bi carbonate is used to raise the ph, or some businesses do so by increasing the ph value of the resin and must.hydroxy methyl furfural ratio is used to keep low thanks to the vacuum boilers used. However, the high consumption of traditional products in the country reduces the demand for healthy and suitable products produced in the factory. A large consumer community is not aware of this pest caused by the breakdown of sugar of fruit acid at high temperatures.
This danger will persist unless the consumption of molasses, which is consumed for breakfast or used as a sweetener in some foods, is replaced by healthy fruit concentrates. According to unofficial data for 2018, the amount of molasses consumed throughout the country is around 30 thousand tons.
Although this local product was tried to be clarified with clay soil taken from nature, it was examined in terms of content and structure in scientific researches, but the deformation during production could not be fully explained.

Molasses production should be saved from local production and directed to production under healthy conditions. Except for certain brands sold in the market that products will continue to scatter poison.

A day later I noticed the bottles were losing shape, filing with bubbles and showing signs of growth similar to a mother at the bottom of vinegar. The liquid inside had become gaseous and opening them released this smelly trapped air temporarily relinquishing the shape of the repurposed bottle. However, later on even with a slightly open cap the air in that liquid was rapidly expanding. This all happened within 48 hours. So instead I poured all the liquid into my outdoor compost hoping it would have some starter effect.

This chapter connects the main requirements of meat product preservation with the most used plastic packaging structures, highlighting the role of packaging on the extension of food products shelf life and allowing their distribution and consumption in the most diverse areas of the world. 

An overview on the main degradation mechanisms of meat products is provided as background for the deeper discussions on flexible packaging films’ compositions that is most used for meat packaging. 

Details on the performance of different sealing materials, gas barrier layers, and structural compositions as well as specific characteristics of packaging such as vacuum bags, shrink barrier bags, thermoforming, vacuum skin, and modified atmosphere packaging are discussed in this chapter serving as building blocks for an optimum packaging design, from food preservation to the final packaging end use. 


Finally, as part of an evolving world, new packaging trends are discussed, covering consumerism, sustainability, and functionality aspects.


The consumption of meat products refers back to the beginning of human history, with first ancient butcher activities believed to start around 10,000 BC . Butchers are present in Bible parables and were an active community in ancient cities as Rome and London fostering the growth of pastoral economy around these places and supplying meat pieces to populations that could afford it. This arrangement was dominant till the eleventh century. The conservation and transportation of meat products were still scarce with rudimentary methodologies as salt and drying, limiting the industry to shops located into larger social agglomerates. Later on, during the 1700s the first slaughterhouse started to pack meat in the USA, fostering industry growth around cattle and pork, but still conservation and transportation were limited and challenging.

First ice trade companies were established in West Virginia, USA, during the early 1800s, and, with the volume expansion of ice commercialized during the late 1800s, the product was also a source of refrigeration for meat products across the USA and few other countries.


 With the advancements of refrigeration cooling systems, new containers and storehouses were designed to preserve perishable products and expand their movement among the countries, establishing logistic chains to transport chilled and frozen meat products safe and efficiently. 

Another interesting finding during this era was the impact of CO2 on meat preservation; it was found during meat product shipment from Australia to England that the use of solid CO2 extended the shelf life more than meat held under ice. 

At this time, rudimentary packaging materials were used to reduce contamination possibilities from production center to consumers.

10153,1,"Dear Denoyelle,

Thanks again for helping. I need to explain that the kind of product we want to coat is not a fruit. For commercial reasons I couldn't post it directly and am searching for the solution indirectly.

We are the rare shrimp snack manufacturer. Recently we've switched to vacuum drying equipment that allows us to make round shaped small shrimp pieces that are very similar in size. Vacuum technology has its limits in terms of dissapearence of flavors if you add them before the processing like we always do on other shrimp that is convection dried. So we can only salt this new shrimp and in need to apply spices and flavors after.

The shrimp is also a perishable seafood. So we control water activity in it and any process that will rehydrate it after is risky. Also if we heat it much we can damage the texture and appearance. So we should keep it in mind.

As we are in Ecuador we are limited on equipment. But what we have here are 6kg batch sized drum coaters that people are using here for chocolate businesses. So it's accessible and can be a starting point for us.

I can't find a way to send you pictures of our shrimp products to send here. If you are open for those kind of consultation I have WhatsApp +593982873007

13135,1,"Hi guys,
I am currently developing a “soy sauce” (naturally flavored, non-fermented, Maggy kind) based on savory natural flavors, vegetable protein hydrolisates, spices, salt , vinegar, and water. After some mixing, the solution is homogenous and completely dissolved. However, after some time left still, a layer separates to the surface. It is sort of foamy but not completely, rather thick liquid compared to the rest of the solution. My sample has around 4% protein. I was investigating the effect of pH (4,2) on the protein thinking that might be the case, and it seems it is making the protein to aggregate and  float to surface. Do you think that is true? I have sent this layer to the lab to characterize it. But if it is, I was wondering how can I avoid this while keeping the same recipe with vinegar to not affect the taste? Some sort of stabilization suggestions? Thanks a lot in advance for any input!"

I'm working with some bitter herbal powder (think reishi mushroom) and am having a hard time coming up with how to mask it.

Inter and intra molecular interactions are the key including entanglement, crosslinking etc.

New peptide bonds, formed by free amino and carboxylic groups of the protein, are suggested responsible for the cross‐linking during protein extrusion. The insoluble aggregate produced inside the extruder, protein‐protein interactions after the superheated molten mass leaves the extruder are all important parameters to be considered during such study.

Even Starch Films have also been developed by the extrusion/thermo-compression technique.

meaning life.  Further, the ‘biotic’ family of terms (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics) coalesces around microbes (or their substrates) . 

Therefore, the term postbiotic appropriately refers to substances derived after the microorganisms are no longer alive, or, in other words, inanimate, dead or inactivated.

The microbes comprising a postbiotic may be inanimate, intact cells or may be structural fragments of microbes, such as cell walls. 

Many preparations of postbiotics also retain microbe-produced substances,
such as metabolites, proteins, or peptides, which may contribute to the overall health effect
conferred by a postbiotic, but such components are not essential to a postbiotic.

A postbiotic must be derived from a well-defined microorganism or combination of microorganisms for which genomic sequences are known and prepared using a delineated technological process of biomass production and inactivation, which can be reliably reproduced.

Benefits.black seed termed as herbal .They have most health benefits and nutrition.Fixed oil and essential oil are obtain from black seed. That fixed oil is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and to some extent thymoquinone, whilst essential oil is abundant in bioactive molecules like thymoquinone, p-cymene, carvacrol, α-thujene and thymol. It has many biological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and wound healing activities.

Biscuits ,being higher in fat contents, would be a better carrier for provision of desirable quantities of antioxidants and tocopherols to the vulnerable segments by adding black cumin fixed and essential oil in various proportions. flour, water, fats (black seed Fixed oil and essential oil), sugars (sucrose, invert) and chemical leaveners (ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and sodium acid pyrophosphate).

Keeping in view the above, the present research proposal was designed to Development black seed oil (fixed & essential ) functional food biscuit and it will be a best value added product in food in market.

**Testing the in vitro Effectiveness of Phosvitin and Carvacrol Against Four Pathogens Involved in Major Foodborne Outbreaks:
Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Staphylococcus aureus**


**Abstract**

Reformulation of food products with natural antimicrobials is a potential solution for several food-related problems: the growing consumers’ request for natural products, the negative health impact due to the presence in foods of artificial antimicrobials, and the risk of emergence of new antimicrobial resistant pathogens. 
The assessment of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has a significant impact on the choice of an antimicrobial strategy and represents the first step in selecting a new antimicrobial to be used in foods. Phosvitin or carvacrol were tested against Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Staphylococcus aureus. Brain heart infusion (BHI) broth with phosvitin (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 mg/ml) or carvacrol (0.09, 0.12, 0.14, 0.19, 0.38, or 0.75 mg/ml) was individually inoculated with selected pathogens (5.0 log10 CFU/ml per pathogen). Growth of each pathogen in BHI (35°C, 24 h) was monitored using the OD600 nm-values (using a Bioscreen C turbidometer) to determine the individual minimum inhibitory concentration for each selected antimicrobial. 
The MIC for tested antimicrobials and pathogens were: 80 mg/ml (phosvitin) for Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7, whereas the MIC of phosvitin for S. aureus is greater than 100 mg/ml. For Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes, the MIC of carvacrol was 0.14 mg/ml. The determined MIC of carvacrol on Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus was 0.12 mg/ml. The use of phosvitin or carvacrol could be considered as natural alternatives to replace the chemical preservatives for the control and inactivation of pathogens in commercially produced foods.

3300,1,"Radioactivity has been around since the earth was created and it exists naturally in the atmosphere, soil, seas and rivers. Inevitably some of this gets into the food we eat.

Radioactivity occurs naturally in all food. Natural radioactivity can be transferred into food in different ways, such as:

* into crops from rocks and minerals present in the soil
* drinking water can pick up radioactivity from the earth
* fish and shellfish can take up radioactivity from the water or sea floor

Artificial radioactivity can also get into food. This can happen when radioactive materials are discharged into the environment from civil or military nuclear operations. Artificial radioactivity then passes through the food chain in the same way as natural radioactivity.

## Radioactivity and our bodies

Radioactivity can damage our body's DNA. Low doses of radiation can be repaired but higher doses can change our body's cells. When this happens, there may be an increased likelihood of developing cancer.

Obviously, [gluten-free sourdough baked goods](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/recipe/sourdough-recipes/sourdough-pancakes/) have the distinct disadvantage of lacking the binding that creates the wheat products we are familiar with. However, there are ways to replace the binding action of gluten with other binders. Many binders are already used in baked goods, such as eggs in various wheat-based pancakes and desserts.

It is important, therefore, to include a binding agent in many gluten-free baked goods, especially the ones which are dependent on gluten for structure, such as yeast breads, pastas, and the like."

2622,1,"Pasta, which is widely consumed in the world and in our country, is an important food item. The most important feature that distinguishes pasta from the other dough products is hard and glassy structure of the wheat.
The most important feature of the pasta is the reaction of the unsaturated fatty acids and oxygen in the presence of lipoxygenase enzymes in the presence of oxygen during the kneading process.
The pasta dough is carried out in two stages as pre- and main drying. The main reason for the pre-drying is the drying of the dough at high temperatures during the main drying process. At the same time, pasta drying process is carried out at high temperatures with an industrial system. One of the main reasons for the drying of pasta dough at high temperatures is the need for high capacity and the other reason is to prevent amylotic activity from forming a sticky product.
Drying is one of the most important techniques in the food industry. The drying process is aimed at reducing the bacterial load of foods with high biological activity and increasing the shelf life.

Drying is an important process for pasta.

Drying process on the surface of the pasta takes place with two physical events.

* Water diffusion of solid matrix of pasta, water coming to product and air interface
* Forced transport to the air through the interface

This is a model to measure the drying efficiency and to determine the parameters of the drying process and the accuracy of the model is checked by comparing this model with industrial systems.

With the developing technologies and software, determination of these processes and accuracy rate has increased. With computational fluid dynamics (CFD), designing and measuring the effectiveness of systems such as mixing, evaporation, drying in the food industry will be even more important in advancing technologies.

In our study, a simple static pasta dryer has an air temperature of 0.005 m / s moisture content of 68% and pasta moisture content of approximately 30% air temperature is determined as 358 kelvin.

Static desiccant was analyzed by Ansys R 19.2 academic and equation analysis was performed in k-epsilon. The data are obtained below.

I think they are unnecessary devices of course except special situations like regions have problems with clean water etc.

A lot of type water purifiers make the water demineralized and this is not good for human healthy

The safety of products is a very important issue for the food industry. Food safety management systems have also been developed by the industry as a result of years of effort, which has led to a significant reduction in food poisoning in most countries.

These systems apply the worldwide accepted HACCP rules. The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) examines food safety management systems under three headings; food safety, food defense and food fraud (adulteration). Food safety measures against unintentional contamination and food poisoning, food and countermeasures and attacks against vulnerable foods. The situation threatens food safety, with the exception of deliberate and unintentional contamination hazards. 

The VACCP system has been developed to protect vulnerable / vulnerable food from food fraud such as adulteration. While HACCP and TACCP concern food producing enterprises, the issues addressed by the VACCP system concern public control. The VACCP system uses similar principles to HACCP, but the focus is on how to identify and control hazards, how to identify and control vulnerabilities. 

Food fraud (adulteration) is the deliberate substitution, addition, unapproved modification, misrepresentation, labeling of food contents, which may or may not affect the health of the consumer for the purpose of economic gain. For example, it is included in the VACCP system, such as the addition of cow's milk to cheese, which we declare to be made from 100% goat's milk, or the addition of sunflower oil, which is cheaper in olive oil. Although it does not pose a danger to human health, it is not appropriate for food safety to include cheap products for profit other than the declared content. risk of being exposed to food or food fraud. At this point, the implementation of the VACCP system minimizes hazards."

**Abstract**

Microorganism contamination at various stages of food chain is one of the major causes for food spoilage that ultimately leads to food waste, increasing food insecurity issues and substantial economic losses. Various synthetic chemical preservatives are being used to control microbial food spoilage and to extend product shelf life. Researchers and consumers are discouraging the use of synthetic preservatives due to their negative health impacts.

Naturally occurring antimicrobials have gained attention among researchers and food manufacturer due to their safety and nontoxic status. Natural preservatives are easy to obtain from plants, animals and microbes. These naturally occurring antimicrobial agents can be isolated from indigenous sources using various advanced techniques. Natural preservatives such as nisin, essential oils, and natamycin have effective potential against spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. The regulations regarding the use of these naturally occurring preservatives are not well defined in some developing countries. 

This chapter focuses on source and their potential role, antimicrobial mechanism in food preservation, and current knowledge on the subject.

The effects of extraction, conventional processing and storage on Natural Anthocyanins colorants in foods were reviewed in this project. The general knowledge available in the relevant literature is broad, yet quite not complete, especially with regards to the anthocyanins derived from food. Current knowledge does not clearly indicate if the extraction process does affect anthocyanin’s properties.

However, there is an indication that different extracting techniques can give different results in the quantities extracted but also in the qualitative characteristics of the extracts obtained. The conventional processing methods have deleterious effects on anthocyanins.


Anthocyanin’s extracts are generally not stabile under high light intensities, at high temperatures, in presence of: oxygen, metal ions, enzymes, sugars, proteins and in aqueous solutions. It would be beneficial to the industry and the consumers if a selection of techniques is made on a case basis to better suit anthocyanin preservation in manufactured products. A re-evaluation of the existing processing methods applied in processing anthocyanin containing products is recommended.

Ethnic food fermentation process forms one of the oldest methods of food preparation and preservation which not only increases the shelf life of the food but have benefits of improving the physiochemical characteristics and nutritional quality. 


The major objective of this study was to document indigenous knowledge of ethnic people of Nagaland on production of some of the popularly consumed fermented food products, analyse the nutritional value and to isolate, characterise and identify the dominant microorganisms of five fermented food products viz, axone/akhuni, anishi, hungrii, rhujuk/bastanga and tsutuocie. A total of 25 samples of axone/akhuni, anishi, hungrii, rhujuk/bastanga and tsutuocie were analyzed for the microbial population. 


On the basis of a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characterization, Bacillus species was found to be the most dominant microorganism in most of the foods. Axone/akhuni and tsutuocie were found to be alkaline in nature with a pH of 8.0 and 8.2. Anishi and hungrii had lower pH of 5.8 and 5.2, whereas Rhujuk/bastanga was acidic (4.7). 

The protein content in axone, anishi, hungrii and rhujuk were in the range of 42-38.9g/100g, whereas the protein content in tsutuocie was found to be as low as 3.2g/100g. The crude fibre content in anishi was found to be higher compared to the other fermented products. 


Of the five fermented food products it was observed that rhujuk had the highest level of phenolic content, followed by hungrii, anishi and axone, while lowest was in tsutuocie.The total flavonoid content in anishi was highest, followed by hungrii, axone and rhujuk whereas lowest was in tsutuocie. Maximum antioxidant activity was recorded in anishi, followed by hungrii, rhujuk and axone. Lowest antioxidant activity was recorded in tsutuocie.

**Abstract**

Chocolate is widely enjoyed in many sweets and foods all over the world. In cocoa butter, fatty acids combine together and give cocoa butter 6 different types of crystals: γ, α, β’(III), β’(IV), β(V) and β(VI). In the industry, the β(V) form that is required, is metastable and gives chocolate its marketable properties. The β(VI) form is also stable but not desirable, because of fat bloom.

The objective of this study is to characterize these polytypes by terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. THz spectroscopy is expected to be a new tool in food industry, as THz energy corresponds to collective molecular macro-vibrations.

Two chocolates from different factories were inspected with optical microscope, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and THz spectroscopy. Optical microscope showed different surface aspects, XRD showed the same species in the two brands and THz spectroscopy showed different features. These differences may be due to fatty acids combination of chocolate.

Hello everyone,

I am interested in classic breads. 
In Turkey, we called classic bread as ""somun ekmek"" . It is made with white wheat flour, water, salt and saccharomyces cerevisiae.

It contains max. 38% water by our food codex.
 
Now in İstanbul 250 g bread price is 1,25 TRY= 0,22 USD

Meat ranks among one of the most significant, nutritious and favored food item available to masses, which aids in fulfilling most of their body requirements. It has played a vital role in human evolution and is an imperative constituent of a well-balanced diet.

It is a good source of proteins, zinc, iron, selenium, and phosphorus followed by vitamin A and B-complex vitamins. Average value of meat protein is about 23% that varies from higher to lower value according to the type of meat source. 

Meat fat and its fatty acid profile is point to worry, with respect to its consumption, but its moderate usage is always advised by doctors and nutritionists, in order to lead a healthy life.

Fat content of animal carcasses ranges between 8 and 20%. Quality traits of meat along with its nutritional composition become dependent upon animal breed type, feeding source (grains, pasture and grass), genetics of animal and post mortem techniques. 

This chapter will mainly focus on the variant aspects of nutritional constituents of meat including proteins and essential amino acids, fats and fatty acid profile, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals along with their health benefits to human health.

When certain disease-causing bacteria, viruses or parasite contaminate food, they can cause food-related diseases. Another word for such a bacterium, virus, or parasite is “pathogen”. Since food-related diseases can be serious, or even fatal, it is important to know and practice safe food-handling behaviors to help reduce the risk of getting sick from contaminated food. 


According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), “food safety is the assurance that food will not cause harm to the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use”. Foodborne diseases are widespread throughout the world. 

The process by which a foodborne disease spreads begins with the features of the disease, contaminating the food, which in turn threatens both individual and public health by means of the foods. Healthy, or what can be termed as safe food, is food that has not lost its nutritional value, that is clean, in physical, chemical and microbiological terms and that is not stale. 

The factors causing the contamination of the food may threaten the safe consumption of it and thereby make the foods harmful to human health. For this reason, it is necessary to utilize various resources to prevent the food from being contaminated in all stages of the food chain, from harvest to consumption. 

The aim of this chapter is to determine the factors affecting food safety and proffer effective intervention strategies against food-related diseases.

![fake-alcohol|690x458](upload://dGjCTxkVjvcbYxw95g2PBTJOr0N.jpeg) 
Fake or illegally produced alcohol is alcohol that is made in unlicensed distilleries or people's homes to be sold.

Fake alcohol may be packaged to look like well-known, legally produced brands. This is known as counterfeiting.

Vodka is the most commonly faked spirit. We advise that if you see vodka on sale at a really cheap price, it probably isn’t vodka.

Properly produced and certified alcoholic drinks are made with ethanol which is a type of alcohol that’s approved for human consumption. Fake alcoholic drinks can be produced using other, cheaper types of alcohol. Drinking them can leave you blind, in a coma or even worse.

Fake alcohol can contain chemicals used in:

* antifreeze
* screen wash
* nail polish remover

### How to spot and avoid fake alcohol

Always remember the ‘4Ps’:

* product – watch out for fake versions as well as brand names you have never heard of
* price – if the price looks too good to be true, it probably is
* packaging – look out for poor quality labelling, spelling mistakes and bottles that have been tampered with
* place – always buy your alcohol from a reputable off-licence or retailer

***You should seek medical advice if you think you’ve drunk fake alcohol.***

Solving the problem of large quantities of organic waste, which represents an enormous ecological and financial burden for all aspects of the process industry, is a necessity. Therefore, there is an emerged need to find specific solutions to utilize raw materials as efficiently as possible in the production process. The cocoa shell is a valuable by-product obtained from the chocolate industry. It is rich in protein, dietary fiber, and ash, as well as in some other valuable bioactive compounds, such as methylxanthines and phenolics. This paper gives an overview of published results related to the cocoa shell, mostly on important bioactive compounds and possible applications of the cocoa shell in different areas. 

The cocoa shell, due to its nutritional value and high-value bioactive compounds, could become a desirable raw material in a large spectrum of functional, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic products, as well as in the production of energy or biofuels in the near future.

Historically, market trends have developed from the use of ingredients in greater quantities - to obtain specific effects in bread (such as fat for crumb softness) - to the use of additives at much lower levels (max. 1%) and, more recently, to enzymes which are used in parts per million (ppm). According to many regulations, enzymes do not need to be declared on the label of the final product, attending the “clean label” trend. We will describe the food additives used under each class, individually describing their mode of action and effects on dough rheology, during the breadmaking process, and on product quality. 

We will also describe the main enzymes currently used, dividing them according to the substrate they act on (gluten, starch, lipids, non-starch polysaccharides or NSPS), individually describing their mode of action and effects on dough rheology, during the breadmaking process, and on product quality. Legal aspects will also be addressed. We will conclude with future trends in the use of additives and processing aids in breadmaking.

Aromas and flavours play an important role in horticultural crops’ quality, namely in fruits. Plant breeders have made considerable advances producing cultivars with higher yields, resistant to pests and diseases, or with high nutritional quality, without paying enough attention to flavour quality. Indeed, consumers have the perception that fruit aromas and flavours have declined in the last years. Attention is given nowadays not only to flavoured compounds but also to compounds with antioxidant activity such as phenolic compounds. 

Fruit flavour is a combination of aroma and taste sensations. Conjugation of sugars, acids, phenolics, and hundreds of volatile compounds contribute to the fruit flavour. However, flavour and aroma depend on the variety, edaphoclimatic conditions, agronomical practices and postharvest handling. This chapter reviews the aromas and flavours of the most important fruits and discusses the most recent advances in the genomics, biochemistry and biotechnology of aromas and flavours.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound treatment for preventing honey crystallization on the physicochemical and microbiological properties of unifloral honey and polyfloral honey. Honey samples without any treatment were used as a control group for comparison. The effect of applying ultrasound treatment was evaluated by studying over time the tendency of crystallization, the rheological properties of honey and chemical and microbiological properties.

The parameters analyzed for the two groups of samples (treated and untreated with ultrasound), which did not vary or had small variations during the research were water content, acidity, water activity, glucose, fructose, sucrose, glucose/water ratio, glucose/fructose ratio. The crystallization process was installed in the control samples from the first month of the study, and much later in the treated samples.

 The color of the untreated samples varied considerably, and the color of the treated ones remained stable or slightly varied. For the control samples, the smallest variation in hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) concentration was in raspberry honey (5%), and the most significant variation was in honeydew honey (30%). For the treated samples, the largest variation of this parameter was found in tillia honey (127%), and the smallest variation was in rapeseed honey (26%). The microbiological quality was higher for the treated samples. 

In the ultrasound-treated samples of acacia honey, honeydew honey and grassland honey, yeasts, molds or standard plate counts (SPCs) were undetectable. For control samples, SPC values were <10–50 cfu/g. Ultrasound-treated samples maintained their SPC parameter levels or were thus reduced (<10–20 cfu/g). Yeasts and molds were undetectable or had value between <10 and 10 cfu/g. The yeasts and the molds ranged in the control samples between <10 and 40 cfu/g.

13781,1,"![FDA Completes Final Administrative Actions on Partially Hydrogenated Oils in Foods|690x360](upload://4V4pjeipHSIURSalbM8PWR5Ilzq.png)


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is issuing a [direct final rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-16725/revocation-of-uses-of-partially-hydrogenated-oils-in-foods) to complete administrative actions that reflect the agency’s June 2015 final determination that the use of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) in foods is no longer Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). In the 2015 final determination, the FDA indicated that there were outdated references to PHOs in regulations that the FDA would address separately. With respect to removing PHOs from the food supply, the FDA established January 1, 2021, as the final compliance date to allow manufacturers time to reformulate foods and ensure an orderly transition in the marketplace.

The FDA’s actions regarding PHOs address artificial sources of trans fat, but trans fat will not be completely removed from the food supply because it occurs naturally in meat and dairy products and is present at very low levels in other edible oils.

The direct final rule:

* Revises regulations to no longer include PHOs as an optional ingredient in the standards of identity for peanut butter and canned tuna
* Revises FDA GRAS affirmation regulations to no longer include partially hydrogenated forms of menhaden and rapeseed oils
* Revokes the regulation for partially hydrogenated fish oil as an indirect food substance
* Revokes pre-1958 authorization for using PHOs in margarine, shortening, and bread, rolls and buns. This authorization occurred before the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 so these uses of PHOs could not be regulated as food additives.

The FDA is issuing these amendments directly as a final rule because it anticipates no significant adverse comments because FDA declared PHOs no longer GRAS for any human food in 2015. However, the agency is issuing a [companion proposed rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-16724/revocation-of-uses-of-partially-hydrogenated-oils-in-foods) in the same issue of the Federal Register in case the direct final rule is withdrawn because significant adverse comments are received, and the agency needs to move forward with a proposed rule to put these changes in place.

The FDA is accepting comments on both the direct final and proposed rules. Comments must be submitted by 75 days after publication in the Federal Register.



The direct final rule would be effective 135 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register.

![The effect of storage temperature on the quality and formation of blooming defects in chocolate confectionery|690x360](upload://ndFcmW3IAAuy9DiG2Ih36Bdbqj0.png)


The study aimed at assessing changes in the quality of certain types of chocolate products over the storage period with particular focus on the formation and development of fat and sugar bloom in chocolate products.

Seven products were selected in collaboration with a chocolate factory to undergo monitoring and analysis and stored at four temperature regimens (6 °C, 12 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C). Five samplings were carried out over the storing period (18 weeks) for evaluation of the dynamics of changes in their quality. Each sampling was accompanied by sensory evaluation; selected physical attributes were also analysed: changes in colour (∆E*ab) within the CIE (L*a*b) system and changes in hardness using the TIRAtest 27025.

The results showed a significant effect of storing temperature on the intensity of changes in the quality of products. 

The results of sensory evaluation of selected products showed that the highest quality for the majority of descriptors was achieved by products stored at temperatures of 6 °C and 12 °C. As regards samples stored under the temperature regimen of 20 °C, the products started to show visible differences, caused primarily by the formation of fat bloom while storing at 30 °C proved to be extremely unsuitable for all the tested products. Since storing temperatures of 6, 12 and 20 °C did not considerably affect hardness and colour of each product, no distinct changes occurred under such temperature regimens. From the aspect of analytical measurements of colour and hardness of each product, storing at temperatures of 20 °C can be termed appropriate. In all the analyses, the effect of the temperature regimen of 30 °C was significantly negative due to defects caused by blooms on the chocolate, meaning that such temperatures are not advisable for storing chocolate products, even over a short term.

Keywords: chocolate; storage temperature; blooming; colour; hardness

## Abstract

Avian influenzas, Ebola, Nipah, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an RNA virus covered by a lipid bilayer, are directly affecting people worldwide. On the other hand, in addition to the main spread source (human contact) of SARS-CoV-2, consumers have started to think about whether foods are dangerous in terms of SARS-CoV-2 spread. The consumption of wild animals as well as the possible contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in fresh and frozen foods have caused concern and increased awareness among consumers. A heating process >70°C is being suggested to eliminate viral contamination risk. Cutting tools, slicing machines, and food-contact surfaces including stainless steel, aluminum, or glass must be regularly sanitized. The sous vide cooking method, which is based on cooking under vacuum and with pH treatments in the range of 3 and 10, could be advised in this risky period for decreasing contamination risk in food. 

Also, recent studies have shown that nanotechnology applications such as nanoparticles could be used to combat the SARS-CoV-2 spread, which is 50–200 nm in size. Another suggested technique is cold plasma technology that could damage the protein structure of the virus. Besides these techniques, it is important to boost the immune system. In this regard, recent researches have revealed the importance of honey consumption (1 g/kg per person/day), intake of vitamins, minerals like selenium, and ω-3 fatty acids.

13759,1,"Hi all!

Tell me, please, maybe someone understands anti-caking agents.

I need an anti-caking agent that will prevent clumping and caking of the powder. The powder consists of several components (glucose, salt, sodium citrate, citric acid, sodium and potassium chlorides). Ideally, the anti-caking agent should dissolve in water and of course be harmless to humans.

What is the best anti-caking agent in your opinion? 
One technologist advised to use bentonite and cellulose. Bentonite as a moisture-retaining agent, cellulose as an agent to aid in powder flow. But both agents do not dissolve in water, plus bentonite gives a black precipitate.

Silicon dioxide is often used, but it also does not dissolve in water and precipitates.

Maybe there are still good options, I would be grateful for the answer!"

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling with vinegar, salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as in some wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the 20th century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. It is sometimes wrongly thought that food additives are a recent development, but there has certainly been an increase in public interest in the topic. Not all of this has been well-informed, and there are signs that commercial interests have been influenced by consumer pressure, as well as food producers manipulating the situation by marketing techniques. Various labeling regulations have been put into effect to ensure that contents of processed foods are known to consumers, and to ensure that food is fresh-important in unprocessed foods and probably important even if preservatives are used. In addition, we also need to add some preservatives in order to prevent the food from spoiling. 

Direct additives are intentionally added to foods for a particular purpose. Indirect additives are added to the food during its processing, packaging and storage. Food Preservatives are the additives that are used to inhibit the growth of bacteria, molds and yeasts in the food. Some of the additives are manufactured from the natural sources such as corn, beet and soybean, while some are artificial, man-made additives. Most people tend to eat the ready-made food available in the market, rather than preparing it at home. Such foods contain some kind of additives and preservatives, so that their quality and flavor is maintained and they are not spoiled by bacteria and yeasts.

I Would like to get some insights on whipped topping (Dairy free).
Are there simpler ways to know which emulsifiers work together? 
1. What are usual emulsifiers which help in increased rosette time ?
2. What are  usual emulsifiers which help in decreasing rosette time ?
3. What are stabilizers ? destabilizers that help in bowl stability.
Need to know the commonly known ingredients used.

I know that these information is available online but somehow they don't work practically. Need guidance basis forum members experience.

Note: Fat is less than 15-17%.. There is no scope to increase.

Thanks is advance"
