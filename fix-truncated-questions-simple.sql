It provides equipment revisions by measuring the design and modeling of new industrial processes and the efficiency of existing equipment. Allows integration with BIM-enabled software and allows modeling. For example, in drier systems, two different parameters are emphasized, static or convective examination of the current in the dryer is done by analyzing the elastic modulus, temperature and air drying during the flow processing. The most important feature is to reach the desired results without creating a prototype.' WHERE id = 79;

UPDATE questions SET content = 'In many countries where milk production is high, a significant amount of milk is used for cheese production. The most important factor determining the yield and quality of cheese in cheese making is the coagulation property of milk. For this reason, coagulation of milk with rennet, which is the basis of cheese production for the dairy industry, is of great importance. The coagulation of casein micelles forms the basis of cheese making. Coagulation occurs in two different ways, usually with acid and enzyme. In both methods, casein changes to insoluble form and forms a non-degradable network structure. In acid coagulation, the protein network is loose, whereas in enzyme coagulation, the protein network is tight and elastic.
